    <h2>
      CHAPTER I&mdash;THE WANDER-FEVER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE great spaces of
      the hall seemed to slope away into impenetrable gloom; velvet darkness
      deepening imperceptibly into sable density of panelled wall; huge,
      smoke-blackened beams, stretching wide arms across the roof, showing only
      as a dim lattice-work of ebony, fretting the shadowy twilight overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the furthermost end, like a giant golden eye winking sleepily through
      the dark, smouldered a fire of logs, and near this, in the luminous circle
      of its warmth, a man and woman were seated at a table lit by tall wax
      candles in branched candlesticks. With its twinkling points of light, and
      the fire&rsquo;s red glow quivering across its shining surface, the table
      gleamed out like a jewel in a sombre setting&mdash;a vivid splash of light
      in the grey immensity of dusk-enfolded hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was evidently just over, for the candlelight shone softly on
      satin-skinned fruit, while wonderful gold-veined glass flecked the dark
      pool of polished mahogany with delicate lines and ripples of opalescent
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence had fallen on the two who had been dining. They had been gay
      enough together throughout the course of the meal, but, now that the
      servants had brought coffee and withdrawn, it seemed as though the
      stillness&mdash;that queer, ghostly, memory-haunted stillness which lurks
      in the dim, disused recesses of a place&mdash;had crept out from the four
      corners of the hall and were stealing upon them, little by little, as the
      tide encroaches on the shore, till it had lapped them round in a curious
      atmosphere of oppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman acknowledged it by a restless twist of her slim shoulders. She
      was quite young&mdash;not more than twenty&mdash;and as she glanced
      half-enquiringly at the man seated opposite her there was sufficiency of
      likeness between the two to warrant the assumption that they were father
      and daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each there was the same intelligent, wide brow, the same straight nose
      with sensitively cut nostrils&mdash;though a smaller and daintier affair
      in the feminine edition, and barred across the top by a little string of
      golden freckles&mdash;and, above all, the same determined, pointed chin
      with the contradictory cleft in it that charmed away its obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here the likeness ended. It was from someone other than the
      dark-browed man with his dreaming, poet&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;which were
      neither purple nor grey, but a mixture of the two&mdash;that Jean Peterson
      had inherited her beech-leaf brown hair, tinged with warm red where the
      light glinted on it, and her vivid hazel eyes&mdash;eyes that were
      sometimes golden like the heart of a topaz and sometimes clear and still
      and brown like the waters of some quiet pool cradled among the rocks of a
      moorland stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were like that now&mdash;clear and wide-open, with a certain pensive,
      half-humorous questioning in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said, at last breaking the long silence. &ldquo;What
      is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked across at her, smiling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be&mdash;anything?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed amusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Glyn dear&rdquo;&mdash;she never made use of the conventional
      address of &ldquo;father.&rdquo; Glyn Peterson would have disliked it
      intensely if she had&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Glyn dear, I haven&rsquo;t been your
      daughter for the last twenty years without learning to divine when you are
      cudgelling your brains as to the prettiest method of introducing a
      disagreeable topic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterson grinned a little. He tossed the end of his cigarette into the
      fire and lit a fresh one before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On this occasion,&rdquo; he observed at last, slowly, &ldquo;the
      topic is not necessarily a disagreeable one. Jean&rdquo;&mdash;his
      quizzical glance raked her face suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;how would you like
      to go to England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tone held the same incredulous excitement that anyone unexpectedly
      invited to week-end at El Dorado might be expected to evince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>England!</i> Glyn, do you really mean to take me there at last?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to go then?&rdquo; A keen observer might have
      noticed a shade of relief pass over Peterson&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like it? It&rsquo;s the one thing above all others that I&rsquo;ve
      longed for. It seems so ridiculous to be an Englishwoman and yet never
      once to have set foot in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s eyes clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not&mdash;entirely&mdash;English,&rdquo; he said in a
      low voice. Jean knew from what memory the quick correction sprang. Her
      mother, the beautiful opera singer who had been the one romance of Glyn
      Peterson&rsquo;s life, had been of French extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she returned soberly. &ldquo;Yet I think I&rsquo;m
      mostly conscious of being English. I believe it&rsquo;s just the very fact
      that I know Paris&mdash;Rome&mdash;Vienna&mdash;so well, and nothing at
      all about England, that makes me feel more absolutely English than
      anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A spark of amusement lit itself in Peterson&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How truly feminine!&rdquo; he commented drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s rather illogical of me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father blew a thin stream of smoke into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God for it!&rdquo; he replied lightly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
      cussed contradictoriness of your sex that makes it so enchanting. If women
      were logical they would be as obvious and boring as the average man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He relapsed into a dreaming silence. Jean broke it rather hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never suggested taking me to England before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face darkened suddenly. It was an extraordinarily expressive face&mdash;expressive
      as a child&rsquo;s, reflecting every shade of his constant changes of
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense of adventure about England,&rdquo; he said
      shortly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dull corner of the world&mdash;bristling with
      the proprieties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean realised how very completely, from his own point of view, he had
      answered her. Romance, beauty, the sheer delight of utter freedom from the
      conventions were as the breath of his nostrils to Glyn Peterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born to the purple, as it were, of an old English county family, he had
      stifled in the conventional atmosphere of his upbringing. There had been
      moments of wild rebellion, bitter outbursts against the established order
      of things, but these had been sedulously checked and discouraged by his
      father, a man of iron will, who took himself and his position intensely
      seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, Glyn had come to accept with more or less philosophy the fact
      of his heirship to old estates and old traditions, with their inevitable
      responsibilities and claims, and he was just preparing to fulfill his
      parents&rsquo; wishes by marrying, suitably and conventionally, when
      Jacqueline Mavory, the beautiful half-French opera singer, had flashed
      into his horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the world was transformed. Artist soul called to artist soul;
      the romantic vein in the man, so long checked and thwarted, suddenly
      asserted itself irresistibly, and the very day before that appointed for
      his wedding, he and Jacqueline ran away together in search of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they had found it. The &ldquo;County&rdquo; had been shocked; Glyn&rsquo;s
      father, unbending descendant of the old Scottish Covenanters, his whole
      creed outraged, had broken under the blow; but the runaway lovers had
      found what they sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Beirnfels, a beautiful old schloss on the eastern border of Austria,
      remote from the world and surrounded by forest-clad hills, Glyn Peterson
      and Jacqueline had lived a romantically happy existence, roaming the world
      whenever the wander-fever seized them, but always returning to Schloss
      Beirnfels, where Peterson had contrived a background of almost exotic
      richness for the adored woman who had flung her career to the winds in
      order to become his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The birth of Jean, two years after their marriage, had been frankly
      regarded by both of them as an inconvenience. It interrupted their idyll.
      They were so essentially lovers that no third&mdash;not even a third born
      of love&rsquo;s consummation&mdash;could be other than superfluous.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had proceeded to shift the new responsibility with characteristic
      lightheartedness. A small army of nursemaids and governesses was engaged,
      and later, when Jean was old enough, she was despatched to one of the best
      Continental schools, whilst her parents continued their customary
      happy-go-lucky existence uninterruptedly. During the holidays she shared
      their wanderings, and Egypt and the southern coast of Europe became
      familiar places to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of seventeen, Jean came home to live at Beirnfels,
      thenceforward regarding her unpractical parents with a species of kindly
      tolerance and amusement. The three of them had lived quite happily
      together, though Jean had remained always the odd man out; but she had
      accepted the fact with a certain humorous philosophy which robbed it of
      half its sting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, two years later, Jacqueline had developed rapid consumption, and
      though Glyn hurried her away to Montavan, in the Swiss Alps, there had
      been no combating the disease, and the romance of a great love had closed
      down suddenly into the grey shadows of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterson had been like a man demented. For a time he had disappeared, and
      no one ever knew, either then or later, how he had first faced the grim
      tragedy which had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had patiently awaited his return to Beirnfels. When at last he came,
      he told her that it was the most beautiful thing which could have happened&mdash;that
      Jacqueline should, have died in the zenith of their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never knew the downward swing of the pendulum,&rdquo; he
      explained. &ldquo;And when we meet again it will be as young lovers who
      have never grown tired. I shall always remember Jacqueline as still
      perfectly beautiful&mdash;never insulted by old age. And when she thinks
      of me&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m still a &lsquo;personable&rsquo; fellow, as
      they say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Glyn, you&rsquo;re still a boy! You&rsquo;ve never grown
      up,&rdquo; Jean made answer. To her he seemed a sort of Peter Pan among
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been amazed&mdash;although in a sense relieved&mdash;to find how
      swiftly he had rallied. It seemed almost as though his intense loathing of
      the onset of old age and decay, of that slow cooling of passion and
      gradual decline of faculties which age inevitably brings, had served to
      reconcile him to the loss of the woman he had worshipped whilst yet there
      had been no dimming of her physical perfection, no blunting of the fine
      edge of their love.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easily comprehensible that to two such temperamental, joy-loving
      beings as Glyn and Jacqueline, England, with her neutral-tinted skies and
      strictness of convention, had made little appeal, and Jean could with
      difficulty harmonise the suddenly projected visit to England with her
      knowledge of her father&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just possible of course, since all which had meant happiness to him
      lay buried in a little mountain cemetery in Switzerland, that it no longer
      mattered to Peterson where he sojourned. One place might be as good&mdash;or
      as bad&mdash;as another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather diffidently Jean voiced her doubts, recalling him from the reverie
      into which he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> go to England?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;God forbid! No,
      you would go without me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterson sprang up and began pacing restlessly to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, without me. I&rsquo;m going away. I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stay
      here any longer. I&rsquo;ve tried, Jean, for your sake&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked across at her with a kind of appeal in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;but I
      can&rsquo;t stand it. I must move on&mdash;get away somewhere by myself.
      Beirnfels&mdash;without her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke off abruptly and stood still, staring down into the heart of the
      fire. Then he added in a wrung voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be a year ago... to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent. Never before had he let her see the raw wound in his
      soul. Latterly she had divined a growing restlessness in him, sensed the
      return of the wander-fever which sometimes obsessed him, but she had not
      realised that it was pain&mdash;sheer, intolerable pain&mdash;which was
      this time driving him forth from the place that had held his happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had appeared so little changed after Jacqueline&rsquo;s death, so much
      the wayward, essentially lovable and unpractical creature of former times,
      still able to find supreme delight in a sunset, or an exquisite picture,
      or a wild ride across the purple hills, that Jean had sometimes marvelled,
      how easily he seemed able to forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, after all, he had not forgotten&mdash;had never been able to forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      The gay, debonair side which he had shown the world&mdash;that same rather
      selfish, beauty-loving, charming personality she had always known&mdash;had
      been only a shell, a husk hiding a hurt that had never healed&mdash;that
      never would find healing in this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt herself submerged beneath a wave of self-reproach that she could
      have thus crudely accepted Glyn&rsquo;s attitude at its face value. But it
      was useless to give expression to her penitence. She could find no words
      which might not wound, and while she was still dully trying to readjust
      her mind to this new aspect of things, her father&rsquo;s voice broke
      across her thoughts&mdash;smooth, polished, with just its usual inflection
      of whimsical amusement, rather as though the world were a good sort of
      joke in which he found himself constrained to take part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made the most paternal arrangements for your welfare in
      my absence, Jean. I want to discuss them with you. You see, I couldn&rsquo;t
      take you with me&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know in the least where I&rsquo;m
      going or where I shall fetch up. That&rsquo;s the charm of it&rdquo;&mdash;his
      face kindling. &ldquo;And it wouldn&rsquo;t be right or proper for me to
      drag a young woman of your age&mdash;and attractions&mdash;half over the
      world with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      By which Jean, not in the least deceived by his air of conscious
      rectitude, comprehended that he didn&rsquo;t want to be bothered with her.
      He was bidding for freedom, untrammelled by any petticoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve written to my old pal, Lady Anne Brennan,&rdquo;
      pursued Peterson, &ldquo;asking if you may stay with her for a little. You
      would have a delightful time. She was quite the most charming woman I knew
      in England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That must be rather more than twenty years ago,&rdquo; observed
      Jean drily. &ldquo;She may have altered a good deal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterson frowned. He hated to have objections raised to any plan that
      particularly appealed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! Why should she change? Anne was not the sort of woman to
      change.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was perfectly aware that her father hadn&rsquo;t the least wish to
      &ldquo;discuss&rdquo; his proposals with her, as he had said. What he
      really wanted was to tell her about them and for her to approve and
      endorse them with enthusiasm&mdash;which is more or less what a man
      usually wants when he suggests discussing plans with his womankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, recognising that he had all his arrangements cut and dried, Jean
      philosophically accepted the fact and prepared to fall in with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And has Lady Anne signified her readiness to take me in for an
      indefinite period?&rdquo; she enquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had her answer yet. But I have no doubt at all what
      form it will take. It will be a splendid opportunity for you, altogether.
      You know, Jean&rdquo;&mdash;pictorially&mdash;&ldquo;you ought really to
      see the &lsquo;stately homes of England.&rsquo; Why, they&rsquo;re&mdash;they&rsquo;re
      your birthright!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean reflected humorously that this point of view had only occurred to him
      now that it chanced to coincide so admirably with his own wishes. Hitherto
      the &ldquo;stately homes of England&rdquo; had been relegated to a quite
      unimportant position in the background and Jean&rsquo;s attention focussed
      more directly upon the unpleasing vagaries of the British climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to go to England,&rdquo; was all she said. Peterson
      smiled at her radiantly&mdash;the smile of a child who has got its own way
      with much less difficulty than it had anticipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall go,&rdquo; he promised her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll adore
      Staple. It&rsquo;s quite a typical old English manor&mdash;lawns and
      terraces all complete, even down to the last detail of a yew hedge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Staple? Is that the Brennans&rsquo; place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless my soul, no! The Tormarins acquired it when they came
      pushing over to England with the Conqueror, I imagine. Anne married twice,
      you know. Her first husband, Tormarin, led her a dog&rsquo;s life, and
      after his death she married Claude Brennan&mdash;son of a junior branch of
      the Brennans. Now she is a widow for the second time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are there any children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two sons. The elder is the son of the first marriage and is the
      owner of Staple, of course. The younger one is the child of the second
      marriage. I believe that since Brennan&rsquo;s death they all three live
      very comfortably together at Staple&mdash;at least, they did ten years ago
      when I last heard from Anne. That was not long after Brennan died.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean wrinkled her brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather a confusing household to be suddenly pitchforked into,&rdquo;
      she commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not dull!&rdquo; submitted Peterson triumphantly. &ldquo;And
      dullness is, after all, the biggest bugbear of existence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As if suddenly stabbed by the palpable pose of his own remark, the light
      died out of his face and he looked round the great dim ball with a
      restless, eager glance, as though trying to impress the picture of it on
      his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beirnfels&mdash;my &lsquo;House of Dreams-Come-True,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      he muttered to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had named it thus in those first glowing days when love had
      transfigured the grim old border castle, turning it into a place of magic
      visions and consummated hopes. The whimsical name took its origin from a
      little song which Jacqueline had been wont to sing to him, her glorious
      voice investing the simple words with a passionate belief and triumph.
      <br /><br /><span class="indent15">It&rsquo;s a strange road leads to the
      House of Dreams, <br /><span class="indent20">To the House of
      Dreams-Come-True, <br /><span class="indent15">Its hills are steep and its
      valleys deep, <br /><span class="indent15">And salt with tears the
      Wayfarers weep, <br /><span class="indent20">The Wayfarers&mdash;I and you.
      <br /><br /><span class="indent15">But there&rsquo;s sure a way to the House
      of Dreams, <br /><span class="indent20">To the House of Dreams-Come-True.
      <br /><span class="indent15">We shall find it yet, ere the sun has set.
      <br /><span class="indent15">If we fare straight on, come fine, come wet,
      <br /><span class="indent20">Wayfarers&mdash;I and you. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Peterson&rsquo;s eyes rested curiously on his daughter&rsquo;s face. There
      was something mystic, almost visionary, in their quiet, absent gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, Jean,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when you meet the only man
      who matters, Beirnfels shall be yours&mdash;the house where <i>your</i>
      dreams shall come true. It&rsquo;s a house of ghosts now&mdash;a dead
      house. But some day you and the man you love will make it live again.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;MADAME DE VARIGNY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN was standing
      looking out from the window of her room in the hotel at Montavan. In the
      distance, the great white peaks of the Alps strained upwards, piercing the
      mass of drifting cloud, whilst below lay a world sheeted in snow, the long
      reach of dazzling purity broken only where the pine-woods etched black
      trunks against the whiteness and the steely gleam of a frozen lake showed
      like a broad blade drawn from a white velvet scabbard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been part of Peterson&rsquo;s expressed programme that, before
      going their separate ways, he and Jean should make a brief stay at
      Montavan, there to await Lady Anne Brennan&rsquo;s answer to his letter.
      Jean had divined in this determination an excuse, covering his need to
      take farewell of that grave on the lonely mountain-side before he set out
      upon the solitary journey which could not fail to hold poignant memories
      of other, former wanderings&mdash;wanderings invested with the exquisite
      joy of sharing each adventure with a beloved fellow-wayfarer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively though Jean had recognised the desire at the back of Glyn&rsquo;s
      decision to stop at Montavan, she was scrupulously careful not to let him
      guess her recognition. She took her cue from his own demeanour, which was
      outwardly that of a man merely travelling for pleasure, and she listened
      with a grim sense of amusement when poor Monsieur Vautrinot, the <i>maître
      d&rsquo;hôtel</i>, recognising Peterson as a former client,
      sympathetically recalled the sad circumstances of his previous visit and
      was roundly snubbed for his pains.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean the loss of her mother had meant far less than it would have done
      to a girl in more commonplace circumstances. It was true that Jacqueline
      had shown herself all that was kindhearted and generous in her genuine
      wish to compass the girl&rsquo;s happiness, and that Jean had been frankly
      fond of her and attracted by her, but in no sense of the words had there
      been any interpretation of a maternal or filial relationship. As Jean
      herself, to the huge entertainment of her parents, had on one occasion
      summed up the situation: &ldquo;Of course I know I&rsquo;m a quite
      superfluous third at Beirnfels, but, all the same, you two really do make
      the most perfect host and hostess, and you try awfully hard not to let me
      feel <i>de trop</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But, despite the fact that Jacqueline had represented little more to her
      daughter than a brilliant and delightful personality with whom
      circumstances happened to have brought her into contact, Jean was
      conscious of a sudden thrill of pain as her glance travelled across the
      wide stretches of snow and came at last to rest on the little burial
      ground which lay half hidden beneath the shoulder of a hill. She was moved
      by an immense consciousness of loss&mdash;not just the mere sense of
      bereavement which the circumstances would naturally have engendered, but
      something more absolute&mdash;a sense of all the exquisite maternal
      element which she had missed in the woman who was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came recognition of the uselessness of such regret. Nothing could
      have made Jacqueline other than she was&mdash;one of the world&rsquo;s
      great lovers. Mated to the man she loved, she asked nothing more of
      Nature, nor had she herself anything more to give. And the same reasoning,
      though perhaps in a less degree, could be applied to Peterson&rsquo;s own
      attitude of detachment towards his daughter; although Jean was intuitively
      aware that she had come to mean much more to him since her mother&rsquo;s
      death, even though it might be, perhaps, only because she represented a
      tangible link with his past happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thrusting aside the oppression of thought conjured up by her glimpse of
      that quiet God&rsquo;s Acre, set high up among the hills, she turned
      abruptly from the window and made her way downstairs to the hotel
      vestibule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she discovered that Peterson had been claimed by some acquaintances.
      The encounter was obviously not of his own choosing, for, to Jean&rsquo;s
      experienced eye, his face bore the slightly restive expression common to
      it when circumstances had momentarily got the better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions were a somewhat elaborate little Frenchman of fifty or
      thereabouts, with an unmistakable air of breeding about him, and a
      stately-looking woman some fifteen years younger, whose warm brunette
      colouring and swift, mobile gesture proclaimed her of Latin blood. All
      three were conversing in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah! La voici qui vient!</i>,&rdquo; Peterson turned as Jean
      approached, his quick exclamation tinctured with relief. Still in French,
      which both he and Jean spoke as fluently and with as little accent as
      English, he continued rapidly: &ldquo;Jean, let me present you to Madame
      la Comtesse de Varigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl found herself looking straight into a pair of eyes of that
      peculiarly opaque, dense brown common to Southern races. They were heavily
      fringed with long black lashes, giving them a fictitiously soft and
      disarming expression, yet Jean was vaguely conscious that their real
      expression held something secret and implacable, almost repellant, an
      impression strengthened by the virile, strongly-marked black brows that
      lay so close above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, Madame de Varigny was undeniably a beautiful woman, her
      blue-black, rather coarse hair framing an oval face, extraordinarily
      attractive in contour, with somewhat high cheek bones and a clever,
      flexible mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s first instinctive feeling was one of distaste. In spite of
      her knowledge that Varigny was one of the oldest names in France, the
      Countess struck her as partaking a little of the adventuress&mdash;of the
      type of woman of no particular birth who has climbed by her wits&mdash;and
      she wondered what position she had occupied prior to her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sharply recalled from her thoughts to find that Madame de Varigny
      was introducing the little middle-aged Frenchman to her as her husband,
      and immediately she spoke Jean felt her suspicions melting away beneath
      the warm, caressing cadences of an unusually beautiful voice. Such a voice
      was a straight passport to the heart. It seemed to clothe even the prosaic
      little Count in an almost romantic atmosphere of tender charm, an effect
      which he speedily dispelled by giving Jean a full, true, and particular
      account of the various pulmonary symptoms which annually induced him to
      seek the high, dry air of Montavan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as an insurance of good health that I come,&rdquo; he
      informed Jean gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, we are not here merely for pleasure&mdash;<i>comme ces
      autres</i>&rdquo;&mdash;-Madame de Varigny gestured smilingly towards a
      merry party of men and girls who had just come in from luging and were
      stamping the snow from off their feet amid gay little outbursts of chaff
      and laughter. &ldquo;We are here just as last year, when we first made the
      acquaintance of Monsieur Peterson&rdquo;&mdash;the suddenly muted quality
      of her voice implied just the right amount of sympathetic recollection&mdash;&ldquo;so
      that <i>mon pauvre mari</i> may assure himself of yet another year of
      health.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The faintly ironical gleam in her eyes convinced Jean that, as she had
      shrewdly begun to suspect, the little Count was a <i>malade imaginaire</i>,
      and once she found herself wondering what could be the circumstances
      responsible for the union of two such dissimilar personalities as the
      high-bred, hypochondriacal little Count and the rather splendid-looking
      but almost certainly plebeian-born woman who was his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She intended, later on, to ask her father if he could supply the key to
      the riddle, but he had contrived to drift off during the course of her
      conversation with the Varignys, and, when at last she found herself free
      to join him, he had disappeared altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought it very probable that he had gone out to watch the progress of
      a ski-ing match to which he had referred with some enthusiasm earlier in
      the day, and she smiled a little at the characteristic way in which he had
      extricated himself, at her expense, from the inconvenience of his
      unexpected recontre with the Varignys.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, two hours later, she realised that once again his superficial air of
      animation had deceived her. From her window she saw him coming along the
      frozen track that led from the hillside cemetery, and for a moment she
      hardly recognised her father in that suddenly shrank, huddled figure of a
      man, stumbling down the path, his head thrust forward and sunken on his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first imperative instinct was to go and meet him. Her whole being
      ached with the longing to let him feel the warm rush of her sympathy, to
      assure him that he was not utterly alone. But she checked the impulse,
      recognising that he had no use for any sympathy or love which she could
      give.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never really been anything other than exterior to his life,
      outside his happiness, and now she felt intuitively that he would wish her
      to remain equally outside the temple of his grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the type of man who would bitterly resent the knowledge that any
      eyes had seen him at a moment of such utter, pitiable self-revelation, and
      it was the measure of her understanding that Jean waited quietly till he
      should choose to come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When he came, he had more or less regained his customary poise,
      though he still looked strained and shaken. He addressed her abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve decided to go straight on to Marseilles and sail by the
      next boat, Jean. There&rsquo;s one I can catch if I start at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At once?&rdquo; she exclaimed, taken aback. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      mean&mdash;to-day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this very evening. I find I can get down to Montreux in time
      for the night mail.&rdquo; Then, answering her unspoken thought: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      be quite all right. You will be certain to hear from Lady Anne in a day or
      two, and, meanwhile, I&rsquo;ll ask Madame de Varigny to play chaperon.
      She&rsquo;ll be delighted&rdquo;&mdash;with a flash of the ironical humour
      that was never long absent from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was she before she married the Count?&rdquo; queried Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you. She is very reticent about her antecedents&mdash;probably
      with good reason&rdquo;&mdash;smiling grimly. &ldquo;But she is a big and
      beautiful person, and our little Count is obviously quite happy in his
      choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is rather a fascinating woman,&rdquo; commented Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;but preferable as a friend rather than an enemy. I don&rsquo;t
      know anything about her, but I wouldn&rsquo;t mind wagering that she has a
      dash of Corsican blood in her. Anyway, she will look after you all right
      till Anne Brennan writes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if no letter comes?&rdquo; suggested Jean. &ldquo;Or supposing
      Lady Anne can&rsquo;t have me? We&rsquo;re rather taking things for
      granted, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded, but cleared again almost instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She <i>will</i> have you. Anne would never refuse a request of
      mine. If not, you must come on to me, and I&rsquo;ll make other
      arrangements,&rdquo;&mdash;vaguely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the next boat
      go, and stay in Paris till I hear from you. But I can&rsquo;t wait here
      any longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, then broke out hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought never to have come to this place. It&rsquo;s haunted. I
      know you&rsquo;ll understand&mdash;you always do understand, I think, you
      quiet child&mdash;why I must go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jean, looking with the clear eyes of unhurt youth into the handsome,
      grief-ravaged face, was suddenly conscious of a shrinking fear of that
      mysterious force called love, which can make, and so swiftly, terribly
      unmake the lives of men and women.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;THE STRANGER ON THE ICE
    </h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;A</span> ND this
      friend of your father&rsquo;s? You have not heard from her yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean and Madame de Varigny were breakfasting together the morning after
      Peterson&rsquo;s departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I hoped a letter might have come for me by this morning&rsquo;s
      post. But I&rsquo;m afraid I shall be on your hands a day or two longer&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a pleasure!&rdquo; Madame de Varigny reassured her
      warmly. &ldquo;My husband and I are here for another week yet. After that
      we go on to St. Moritz. He is suddenly discontented with Montavan. If, by
      any chance, you have not then heard from Lady&mdash;Lady&mdash;I forget
      the name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Anne Brennan,&rdquo; supplied Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      A curiously concentrated expression seemed to flit for an instant across
      Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s face, but she continued smoothly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais, oui</i>&mdash;Lady Brennan. <i>Eh bien</i>, if you have
      not heard from her by the time we leave for St. Moritz, you must come with
      us. It would add greatly to our pleasure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; replied Jean. She felt frankly
      grateful for the suggestion, realising that if, by any mischance, the
      letter should be delayed till then, Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s offer would
      considerably smooth her path. In spite of Glyn&rsquo;s decision that she
      must join him in Paris, should Lady Anne&rsquo;s invitation fail to
      materialise, she was well aware that he would not greet her appearance on
      the scene with any enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;the Countess was speaking again&mdash;&ldquo;I
      suppose Brennan is a very frequent&mdash;a common name in England?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was put quite casually, more as though for the sake of making
      conversation than anything else, yet Madame de Varigny seemed to await the
      answer with a curious anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; Jean replied readily enough, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think it is a common name. Lady Anne married into a junior branch of the
      family, I believe,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would not be considered a very good match for a peer&rsquo;s
      daughter, surely?&rdquo; hazarded the Countess. &ldquo;A junior branch? I
      suppose there was a romantic love-affair of some kind behind it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Lady Anne&rsquo;s second marriage. Her first husband was a
      Tormarin&mdash;one of the oldest families in England.&rdquo; Jean spoke
      rather stiffly. There was something jarring about the pertinacious
      catechism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s lips trembled as she put her next question, and
      not even the dusky fringe of lashes could quite soften the sudden tense
      gleam in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tor&mdash;ma&mdash;rin!&rdquo; She pronounced the name with a
      French inflection, evidently finding the unusual English word a little
      beyond her powers. &ldquo;What a curious name! That, I am sure, must be
      uncommon. And this Lady Anne&mdash;she has children&mdash;sons? No?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. She has two sons.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Madame de Varigny looked interested. &ldquo;And what
      are the sons called?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean regarded her with mild surprise. Apparently the subject of
      nomenclature had a peculiar fascination for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really forget. My father did once tell me, but I don&rsquo;t
      recollect what he said.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A perceptible shade of disappointment passed over the other&rsquo;s face,
      then, as though realising that she had exhibited a rather uncalled-for
      curiosity, she said deprecatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear I seem intrusive. But I am so interested in your future&mdash;I
      have taken a great fancy to you, mademoiselle. That must be my excuse.&rdquo;
      She rose from the table, adding smilingly: &ldquo;At least you will not
      find it dull, since Lady Anne has two sons. They will he companions for
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rose, too, and together they passed out of the <i>salle à manger</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you propose to do with yourself to-day?&rdquo; asked
      the Countess, pausing in the hall. &ldquo;My husband and I are going for a
      sleigh drive. Would you care to come with us? We should he delighted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you. But I should really like to try my
      luck on the ice. I haven&rsquo;t skated for some years, and as I feel a
      trifle shaky about beginning again, Monsieur Griolet, who directs the
      sports, has promised to coach me up a bit some time this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bon!</i>&rdquo; Madame de Varigny nodded pleasantly. &ldquo;You
      will be well occupied while we are away. Au revoir, then, till our return.
      Perhaps we shall walk down to the rink later to witness your progress
      under Monsieur Groilet&rsquo;s instruction.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled mischievously, the smile irradiating her face with a sudden
      charm. Jean felt as though, for a moment, she had glimpsed the woman the
      Countess might have been but for some happening in her life which had
      soured and embittered it, setting that strange implacability within the
      liquid depths of her soft, southern eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still speculating on Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s curious personality
      as she made her way along the beaten track that led towards the rink, and
      then, as a sudden turn of the way brought the sheet of ice suddenly into
      full view, all thoughts concerning the bunch of contradictions that goes
      to make up individual character were swept out of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the glory of the morning sunlight the stretch of frozen water gleamed
      like a shield of burnished silver, whilst on its further side rose great
      pine-woods, mysteriously dark and silent, climbing the steeply rising
      ground towards the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of people skating, and Jean discovered Monsieur
      Griolet in the distance, supervising the practice of a pretty American
      girl who was cutting figures with an ease and exquisite balance of lithe
      body that hardly seemed to stand in need of the instructions he poured
      forth so volubly. Probably, Jean decided, the American had entered for
      some match and was being coached up to concert pitch accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood for a little time watching with interest the varied performances
      of the skaters. Bands of light-hearted young folk, indulging in the sport
      just for the sheer enjoyment of it, sped gaily by, broken snatches of
      their talk and laughter drifting back to her as they passed, whilst groups
      of more accomplished skaters performed intricate evolutions with an
      earnestness and intensity of purpose almost worthy of a better cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt herself a little stranded and forlorn. She would have liked
      someone to share her enthusiasm for the marvels achieved by the
      figure-skaters&mdash;and to laugh with her a little at their deadly
      seriousness and at the scraps of heated argument anent the various schools
      of technique which came to her, borne on the still, clear air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently her attention was attracted by the solitary figure of a man who
      swept past her in the course of making a complete circle of the rink. He
      skimmed the ice with the free assurance of an expert, and as he passed,
      Jean caught a fleeting glimpse of a supple, sinewy figure, and of a lean,
      dark face, down-bent, with a cap crammed low on to the somewhat scowling
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something curiously distinctive about the man. Brief as was her
      vision of him, it possessed an odd definiteness&mdash;a vividness of
      impression that was rather startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed by, his arms folded across his chest, moving with long,
      rhythmic strokes which soon carried him to the further side of the rink.
      Jean&rsquo;s eyes followed him interestedly. He was unmistakably an
      Englishman, and he seemed to be as solitary as herself, but, unlike her,
      he appeared indifferent to the fact, absorbed in his own thoughts which,
      to judge by the sullen, brooding expression of his face, were not
      particularly pleasant ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon she lost sight of him amid the scattered groups of smoothly gliding
      figures. The scene reminded her of a cinema show. People darted suddenly
      into the picture, materialising in full detail in the space of a moment,
      then rushed out of it again, dwindling into insignificant black dots which
      merged themselves into the continuously shifting throng beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she bent her steps towards the lower end of the rink, by common
      consent reserved for beginners in the art of skating. She had not skated
      for several years, owing to a severe strain which had left her with a weak
      ankle, and she felt somewhat nervous about starting again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather slowly she fastened on her skates and ventured tentatively on to
      the ice. For a few minutes she suffered from a devastating feeling that
      her legs didn&rsquo;t belong to her, and wished heartily that she had
      never quitted the safe security of the bank, but before long her
      confidence returned, and with it that flexible ease of balance which, once
      acquired, is never really lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time she was thoroughly enjoying the rapid, effortless motion,
      and felt herself equal to steering a safe course beyond the narrow limits
      of the &ldquo;Mugs&rsquo; Corner&rdquo;&mdash;as that portion of the ice
      allotted to novices was unkindly dubbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She struck out for the middle of the rink, gradually increasing her speed
      and revelling in the sting of the keen, cold air against her face. Then,
      all at once, it seemed as though the solid surface gave way beneath her
      foot. She lurched forward, flung violently off her balance, and in the
      same moment the sharp clink of metal upon ice betrayed the cause. One of
      her skates, insecurely fastened, had come off.
    </p>
    <p>
      She staggered wildly, and in another instant would have fallen had not
      someone, swift as a shadow, glided suddenly abreast of her and, slipping a
      supporting arm round her waist, skated smoothly beside her, little by
      little slackening their mutual pace until Jean, on one blade all this
      time, could stop without danger of falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they glided to a standstill, she turned to offer her thanks and found
      herself looking straight into the lean, dark face of the Englishman who
      had passed her when she had been watching the skaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted his cap, and as he stood for a moment bare-headed beside her,
      she noticed with a curious little shock&mdash;half surprised, half
      appreciative&mdash;that on the left temple his dark brown hair was
      streaked with a single pure white lock, as though a finger had been laid
      upon the hair and bleached it where it lay. It conferred a certain air of
      distinction&mdash;an added value of contrast&mdash;just as the sharp black
      shadow in a neutral-tinted picture gives sudden significance to the whole
      conception.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was regarding Jean with a flicker of amusement in his grey
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a near thing!&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently he judged her to be a Frenchwoman, for he spoke in French&mdash;very
      fluently, but with an unmistakable English accent. Instinctively Jean, who
      all her life had been as frequently called upon to converse in French as
      English, responded in the same language.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was breathing rather quickly, a little shaken by the suddenness of the
      incident, and his face took on a shade of concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not hurt, I hope? Did you twist your ankle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;oh, no,&rdquo; she smiled up at him. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      have fastened my skate on properly, and when it shot off like that I&rsquo;m
      afraid I rather lost my head. You see,&rdquo; she added explanatorily,
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t skated for some years. And I was never very
      proficient.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said gravely. &ldquo;It was a little rash of you
      to start again quite alone, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it was. However, as you luckily happened to be there to
      save me from the consequences, no harm is done. Thank you so much.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of dismissal in her voice, but apparently he failed to
      notice it, for he held out his hands to her crosswise, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me help you to the bank, and then I&rsquo;ll retrieve your
      errant skate for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He so evidently expected her to comply with his suggestion that, almost
      without her own volition, she found herself moving with him towards the
      edge of the rink, her hands grasped in a close, steady clasp, and a moment
      later she was scrambling up the bank. Once more on level ground, she made
      a movement to withdraw her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can manage quite well now,&rdquo; she said rather nervously.
      There was something in that strong, firm grip of his which sent a curious
      tremor of consciousness through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, but released her instantly, and in her anxiety to show
      him how well she could manage she hurried on, struck the tip of the skate
      she was still wearing against a little hummock of frozen snow, and all but
      fell. He caught her as she stumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think.&rdquo; he remarked drily, &ldquo;you would do well to
      sacrifice your independence till your feet are on more equal terms with
      one another.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean laughed ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should,&rdquo; she agreed meekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led her to where the prone trunk of a tree offered a seat of sorts,
      then went in search of the missing skate. Returning in a few moments, he
      knelt beside her and fastened it on&mdash;securely this time&mdash;to the
      slender foot she extended towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re much too incompetent to be out on the ice alone,&rdquo;
      he remarked as he buckled the last strap.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush of annoyance rose in Jean&rsquo;s cheeks at the
      uncompromising frankness of the observation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are your friends thinking of to let you do such a thing?&rdquo;
      he pursued, blandly ignoring her mute indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no friends here. I am&mdash;my own mistress,&rdquo; she
      replied rather tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still kneeling in the snow in front of her. Now he sat back on his
      heels and subjected her face to a sharp, swift scrutiny. Almost, she
      thought, she detected a sudden veiled suspicion in the keen glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the sort of girl to be knocking about&mdash;alone&mdash;at
      a hotel,&rdquo; he said at last, as though satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what I&rsquo;m like?&rdquo; she retorted quickly,
      &ldquo;You are hardly qualified to judge.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Pardon, mademoiselle</i>, I do not know what you are&mdash;but I
      do know very certainly what you are not. And&rdquo;&mdash;smiling a little&mdash;&ldquo;I
      think we have just had ocular demonstration of the fact that you&rsquo;re
      not accustomed to fending for yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something singularly attractive about his smile. It lightened
      his whole face, contradicting the settled gravity that seemed habitual to
      it, and Jean found herself smiling back in response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; she admitted.
      &ldquo;I came here with my father, and he was&mdash;was suddenly called
      away. I am going on to stay with friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my last day here,&rdquo; he remarked with sudden
      irrelevance. &ldquo;I am off first thing to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not stopping at the hotel, are you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m staying at a friend&rsquo;s chalet a little way
      beyond it. <i>Mais, voyons, mademoiselle</i>, you will catch cold sitting
      there. Are you too frightened to try the ice again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to assume that her next essay would be made in his company. Jean
      spoke a little hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I was supposed to have a lesson with Monsieur Griolet this
      morning. He is an instructor,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;But he was
      engaged coaching someone else when I came out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And which is this Monsieur Griolet? Can you see him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s glance ranged over the scattered figures on the rink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. There he is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes followed the direction indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seems to be well occupied at the moment,&rdquo; he commented.
      &ldquo;Suppose&mdash;would you allow me to act as coach instead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated. This stranger appeared to be uncompromisingly progressive
      in his tendencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly capable,&rdquo; he added curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of that. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes twinkled. &ldquo;But it would not be quite <i>comme il faut?</i>
      Is that it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t, would it?&rdquo; she retaliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face grew suddenly grave, and she noticed that when in repose there
      were deep, straight lines on either side of his mouth&mdash;lines that are
      usually only furrowed by severe suffering, either mental or physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;To-day, it seems, we
      are two very lonely people. Couldn&rsquo;t we forget what is <i>comme il
      faut</i> for once? We shall probably never meet again. We know nothing of
      each other&mdash;just &lsquo;ships that pass in the night.&rsquo; Let us
      keep one another company&mdash;take this one day together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a step nearer to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking down at her with eyes that were curiously bright and
      compelling. There was a tense note in his voice which once again sent that
      disconcerting tremor of consciousness tingling through her blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that his proposal was impertinent, unconventional, even regarded
      from the standpoint of the modern broad interpretation of the word
      convention, and that by every law of Mrs. Grundy she ought to snub him
      soundly for his presumption and retrace her steps to the hotel with all
      the dignity at her command.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did none of these things. Instead, she stood hesitating,
      alternately flushing and paling beneath the oddly concentrated gaze he
      bent on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it shall bind you to nothing,&rdquo; he pursued urgently.
      &ldquo;Not even to recognising me in the street should our ways ever
      chance to cross again. Though that is hardly likely to occur&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a shrug&mdash;&ldquo;seeing that mademoiselle is French and that I am
      rarely out of England. It will be just one day that we shall have shared
      together out of the whole of life, and after that the &lsquo;darkness
      again and a silence.&rsquo;.... I can promise you the &lsquo;silence&rsquo;!&rdquo;
      he added with a sudden harsh inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that bitter note which won the day. In some subtle, subconscious
      way Jean sensed the pain which lay at the back of it. She answered
      impulsively:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. It shall be as you wish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A rarely sweet smile curved the man&rsquo;s grave lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said simply.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE STOLEN DAY
    </h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;E</span> NCORE <i>une
      fois!</i> Bravo! That went better!&rdquo; Monsieur Griolet&rsquo;s
      understudy had amply justified his claim to capability. After a morning&rsquo;s
      tuition at his hands, Jean found her prowess in the art of skating
      considerably enhanced. She was even beginning to master the mysteries of
      &ldquo;cross-cuts&rdquo; and &ldquo;rocking turns,&rdquo; and a somewhat
      attenuated figure eight lay freshly scored on the ice to her credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are really a wonderful instructor,&rdquo; she acknowledged,
      surveying the graven witness to her progress with considerable
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her self-appointed teacher smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is something to be said for the pupil, also,&rdquo; he
      replied. &ldquo;But now&rdquo;&mdash;glancing at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;I
      vote we call a halt for lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lunch!&rdquo; Jean&rsquo;s glance measured the distance to the
      hotel with some dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not lunch at the hotel,&rdquo; interposed her companion
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean regarded him with curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where then, monsieur?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up there!&rdquo; he pointed towards the pine-woods. &ldquo;Above
      the woods there is a hut of sorts&mdash;erected as a shelter in case of
      sudden storms for people coming up from the lower valley to Montavan and
      beyond. It&rsquo;s a rough little shanty, but it would serve very well as
      a temporary salle à manger. It isn&rsquo;t a long climb,&rdquo; he added
      persuasively. &ldquo;Are you too tired to take it on after your recent
      exertion?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. But are you expecting a wayside refuge of that
      description to be miraculously endowed with a well-furnished larder?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But I think my knapsack can make good the deficiency.&rdquo; he
      replied composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean looked at him with dancing eyes. Having once yielded to the day&rsquo;s
      unconventional adventure, she had surrendered herself whole-heartedly to
      the enjoyment of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made one reservation, however. Some instinct of self-protection
      prevented her from enlightening her companion as to her partly English
      nationality. There was no real necessity for it, seeing that he spoke
      French with the utmost fluency, and his assumption that she was a
      Frenchwoman seemed in some way to limit the feeling of intimacy,
      conferring on her, as it were, a little of the freedom of an incognito.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>A la bonne heure!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed gaily. &ldquo;So you
      invite me to share your lunch, <i>monsieur le professeur?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve invited you to share my day, haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he
      replied, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      They steered for the bank, and when he had helped off her skates and
      removed his own, slinging them over his arm, they started off along the
      steep white track which wound its way upwards through the pine-woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they left the bright sunlight that still glittered on the snowy slopes
      behind them, it seemed as though they plunged suddenly into another world&mdash;a
      still, mysterious, twilit place, where the snow underfoot muffled the
      sound of their steps and the long shadows of the pines barred their path
      with sinister, distorted shapes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, always sensitive to her surroundings, shivered a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather eerie, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      just as if someone had suddenly turned the lights out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a nice bit of symbolism,&rdquo; he returned enigmatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? I don&rsquo;t think I understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should you? You&rsquo;re young. Fate doesn&rsquo;t come along
      and snuff out the lights for you when you are&mdash;what shall we say?
      Eighteen?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re two years out,&rdquo; replied Jean composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As much? Then let&rsquo;s hope you&rsquo;ll have so much the longer
      to wait before Madame Destiny comes round with her snuffers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a kind of bitter humour, the backwash, surely, of some storm
      through which he must have passed. Jean looked across at him with a vague
      trouble in her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, do you think&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke uncertainly&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you believe it is inevitable that she will come&mdash;sooner or later?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not&mdash;to you,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;But she
      comes to most of us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She longed to put another question, but there was a note of finality in
      his voice&mdash;a kind of &ldquo;thus far shalt thou come and no further&rdquo;&mdash;that
      warned her to probe no deeper. Whatever it was of bitterness that lay in
      the Englishman&rsquo;s past, he had no intention of sharing the knowledge
      with his chance companion of a day. He seemed to have become absorbed once
      more in his own thoughts, and for a time they tramped along together in
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ascent steepened perceptibly, and Jean, light and active as she was,
      found it hard work to keep pace with the man&rsquo;s steady, swinging
      stride. Apparently his thoughts engrossed him to the exclusion of
      everything else, for he appeared to have utterly forgotten her existence.
      It was only when a slip of her foot on the beaten surface of the snow
      wrung a quick exclamation from her that he paused, wheeling round in
      consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon! I&rsquo;m walking you off your legs! Why on
      earth didn&rsquo;t you stop me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something irresistibly boyish about the quick apology. Jean
      laughed, a little breathless from the swift climb uphill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seemed so bent on getting to the top in the least possible
      time,&rdquo; she replied demurely, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t like to
      disappoint you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I make a poor sort of guide,&rdquo; he admitted.
      &ldquo;I was thinking of something else. You must forgive me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They resumed their climb more leisurely. The trees were thinning a bit
      now, and ahead, between the tall, straight trunks winged with drooping,
      snow-laden branches, they could catch glimpses of the white world beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently they came out above the pine-wood on to the edge of a broad
      plateau and Jean uttered an exclamation of delight, gazing spell-bound at
      the scene thus suddenly unfolded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind them, in the pine-ringed valley, a frozen reach of water gleamed
      like a dull sheet of metal, whilst before them, far above, stretched the
      great chain of mountains, pinnacle after pinnacle, capped with snow,
      thrusting up into the cloud-swept sky. Through rifts in the cloud&mdash;almost,
      it seemed, torn in the breast of heaven by those towering peaks&mdash;the
      sunlight slanted in long shafts, chequering the snows with shimmering
      patches of pale gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was worth the climb, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman, his gaze on Jean&rsquo;s rapt face, broke the silence
      abruptly. She turned to him, radiant-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful that it makes one&rsquo;s heart ache!&rdquo;
      she exclaimed, laying her hand on her breast with the little foreign turn
      of gesture she derived from her French ancestry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said no more, but remained very still, drinking in the sheer
      loveliness of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man regarded her quietly as she stood there silhouetted against the
      skyline, her slim, brown-clad figure striking a warm note amid the chill
      Alpine whites and greys. Her face was slightly tilted, and as the sunshine
      glinted on her hair and eyes, waking the russet lights that slumbered in
      them, there was something vividly arresting about her&mdash;a splendour of
      ardent youth which brought a somewhat wistful expression into the rather
      weary eyes of the man watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thought travelled hack to the brief snatch of conversation evoked by
      the sudden gloom of the pine-woods. Surely, for once, Fate would lay aside
      her snuffers and let this young, eager life pass by unshadowed!
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the thought took shape in his mind, Jean turned to him again, her
      face still radiant, &ldquo;Thank you for bringing me up here,&rdquo; she
      said simply. &ldquo;It has been perfect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hand, and he took it and held it in his for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;ve liked it,&rdquo; he answered quietly.
      &ldquo;It will always be a part of our day together&mdash;the day we stole
      from <i>les convenances</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled whimsically. &ldquo;And
      now, if you can bring yourself back to more prosaic matters, I suggest we
      have lunch. Scenery, however fine, isn&rsquo;t exactly calculated to
      sustain life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most material person!&rdquo; She laughed up at him. &ldquo;I
      suppose you think a ham sandwich worth all the scenery in the world?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll admit to a preference for the sandwich at the moment,&rdquo;
      he acknowledged. &ldquo;Come, now, confess! Aren&rsquo;t you hungry, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Starving! This air makes me feel as if I&rsquo;d never had anything
      to eat in my life before!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, come and inspect my <i>salle à manger</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The proposed refuge proved to be a roughly constructed little hut&mdash;hardly
      more than a shed provided with a door and thick-paned window, its only
      furniture a wooden bench and table. But that it had served its purpose as
      a kind of &ldquo;travellers&rsquo; rest&rdquo; was proved by the fragments
      of appreciation, both in prose and verse, that were to be found inscribed
      in a species of &ldquo;Visitors&rsquo; Book&rdquo; which lay on the table,
      carefully preserved from damp in a strong metal box. Jean amused herself
      by perusing the various contributions to its pages while the Englishman
      unpacked the contents of his knapsack.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch that followed was a merry little meal, the two conversing with a
      happy intimacy and freedom from reserve based on the reassuring knowledge
      that they would, in all probability, never meet again. Afterwards, they
      bent their energies to concerting a suitable inscription for insertion in
      the &ldquo;Visitors&rsquo; Book,&rdquo; squabbling like a couple of
      children over the particular form it should take.
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed were they in the discussion that they failed to notice the
      perceptible cooling of the temperature. The sun no longer warmed the
      roofing of the hut, and there was a desolate note in the sudden gusts of
      wind which shook the door at frequent intervals as though trying to
      attract the attention of those within. Presently a louder rattle than
      usual, coincident with a chance pause in the conversation, roused them
      effectually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman&rsquo;s keen glance flashed to the little window, through
      which was visible a dancing, whirling blur of white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; he exclaimed in good round English. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      snowing like the very dickens!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In two strides he had reached the door, and, throwing it open, peered out.
      A draught of icy air rushed into the hut, accompanied by a flurry of fine
      snow driven on the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he turned back, his face had assumed a sudden look of gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go at once,&rdquo; he said, speaking in French again and
      apparently unconscious of his momentary lapse into his native tongue.
      &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t, we shan&rsquo;t be able to get back at all. The
      snow drifts quickly in the valley. Half an hour more of this and we
      shouldn&rsquo;t be able to get through.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean thrust the Visitors&rsquo; Book back into its box, and began hastily
      repacking her companion&rsquo;s, knapsack, but he stopped her almost
      roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. Fasten that fur thing closer round your throat and
      come on. There&rsquo;s no taking chances in a blizzard like this. Don&rsquo;t
      you understand?&rdquo;&mdash;almost roughly. &ldquo;If we waste time we
      may have to spend the night here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Impelled by the sudden urgency of his tones, Jean followed him swiftly out
      of the hut, and the wind, as though baulked by her haste, snatched the
      door from her grasp and drove it to with a menacing thud behind them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;AMONG THE SNOWS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S Jean stepped
      outside the hut it seemed as though she had walked straight into the heart
      of the storm. The bitter, ice-laden blast that bore down from the
      mountains caught away her breath, the fine driving flakes, crystal-hard,
      whipped her face, almost blinding her with the fury of their onslaught,
      whilst her feet slipped and slid on the newly fallen snow as she trudged
      along beside the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a good preparation for a dance!&rdquo; she gasped
      breathlessly, forcing her chilled lips to a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a dance? What dance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a fancy dress ball at the hotel to-night. There won&rsquo;t
      be&mdash;much of me&mdash;left to dance, will there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman laughed suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My chief concern is to get you back to the hotel&mdash;alive,&rdquo;
      he observed grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean looked at him quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo; she asked more soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. At least I hope not. I didn&rsquo;t mean to frighten you&rdquo;&mdash;hastily.
      &ldquo;Only it seemed a trifle incongruous to be contemplating a dance
      when we may be struggling through several feet of snow in half an hour.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fierce gusts of wind, lashing the snow about them in bewildering
      eddies, made conversation difficult, and they pushed on in a silence
      broken only by an occasional word of encouragement from the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right?&rdquo; he queried once, as Jean paused, battered and
      spent with the fury of the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded speechlessly. She had no breath left to answer, but once again
      her lips curved in a plucky little smile. A fresh onslaught of the wind
      forced them onwards, and she staggered a little as it blustered by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said quickly. &ldquo;Take my arm. It will be better
      when we get into the pine-wood. The trees there will give us some
      protection.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They struggled forward again, arm in arm. The swirling snow had blotted
      out the distant mountains; lowering storm-filled clouds made a grey
      twilight of the day, through which they could just discern ahead the
      vague, formless darkness of the pine-wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another ten minutes walking brought them to it, only to find that the
      blunted edge of the storm was almost counterbalanced by the added
      difficulties of the surrounding gloom. High up overhead they could hear
      the ominous creak and swing of great branches shaken like toys in the
      wind, and now and again the sharper crack of some limb wrenched violently
      from its parent trunk. Once there came the echoing crash of a tree torn up
      bodily and flung to earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse here,&rdquo; declared Jean, &ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a nervous laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d rather die in the open!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be preferable. Only you&rsquo;re not going to die at all,
      if I can help it,&rdquo; the Englishman returned composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, cool though he appeared, he experienced a thrill of keen anxiety as
      they emerged from the pine-wood and his quick eyes scanned the dangerously
      rapid drifting of the snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind was racing down the valley now, driving the snow before it and
      piling it up, inch by inch, foot by foot, against the steep ground which
      skirted the sheet of ice where they had been skating but a few hours
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the pitiless beating of the snow Jean strove to read her companion&rsquo;s
      face. It was grim and set, the lean jaw thrust out a little and the grey
      eyes tense and concentrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we get through?&rdquo; she asked, raising her voice so that it
      might carry against the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we can get through the drifted snow between here and the track
      on the left, we&rsquo;re all right,&rdquo; answered the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wind&rsquo;s slanting across the valley and there&rsquo;ll be
      no drifts on the further side. I wish I&rsquo;d got a bit of rope with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pockets, finally producing the rolled-up strap of a
      suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have,&rdquo; he said discontentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s to go round your waist. I don&rsquo;t want to lose you&rdquo;&mdash;smiling
      briefly&mdash;&ldquo;if you should stumble into deep snow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deep snow? But it&rsquo;s only been snowing an hour or so!&rdquo;
      she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently you don&rsquo;t know what a blizzard can accomplish in
      the way of drifting during the course of an &lsquo;hour or so.&rsquo; I
      do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Deftly he fastened the strap round her waist, and, taking the loose end,
      gave it a double turn about his wrist before gripping it firmly in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, keep close behind me. Regard me&rdquo;&mdash;laughing shortly&mdash;&ldquo;as
      a snow-plough. And if I go down deep rather suddenly, throw your weight
      backward as much as you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved forward, advancing cautiously. He was badly handicapped by the
      lack of even a stick with which to gauge the depth of drifting snow in
      front of him, and he tested each step before trusting his full weight to
      the delusive, innocent-looking surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean went forward steadily beside him, a little to the rear. The snow was
      everywhere considerably more than ankle-deep, and at each step she could
      feel that the slope of the ground increased and with it the depth of the
      drift through which they toiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold was intense. The icy fingers of the snow about her feet seemed to
      creep upward and upward till her whole body felt numbed and dead, and as
      she stumbled along in the Englishman&rsquo;s wake, buffeted and beaten by
      the storm, her feet ached as if leaden weights were attached to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she struggled on pluckily. The man in front of her was taking the
      brunt of the hardship, cutting a path for her, as it were, with his own
      body as he forged ahead, and she was determined not to add to his work by
      putting any weight on the strap which bound them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once he gave a sharp exclamation and pulled up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting much deeper,&rdquo; he called out, turning back
      to her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get through, hampered with your skirts.
      I&rsquo;m going to carry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head, and shouted back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> wouldn&rsquo;t get through, handicapped like that. No,
      let&rsquo;s push on as we are. I&rsquo;ll manage somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A glint of something like admiration flickered in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Game little devil!&rdquo; he muttered. But the wind caught up the
      words, and Jean did not hear them. He raised his voice again, releasing
      the strap from his wrist as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do what I tell you. It&rsquo;s only a matter of
      getting through this bit of drift, and we&rsquo;ll be out of the worst of
      it. Put your arms round my neck.&rdquo; Then, as she hesitated: &ldquo;Do
      you hear? Put your arms round my neck&mdash;<i>quick!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The dominant ring in his voice impelled her. Obediently she clasped her
      arms about his neck as he stooped, and the next moment she felt herself
      swung upward, almost as easily as a child, and firmly held in the embrace
      of arms like steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few yards he made good progress, thrusting his way through the
      yielding snow. But the task of carrying a young woman of average height
      and weight is no light one, even to a strong man and without the added
      difficulty of plunging through snow that yields treacherously at every
      step, and Jean could guess the strain entailed upon him by the double
      burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do put me down!&rdquo; she urged him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I
      can walk it&mdash;really I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look down!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Think you could travel in that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The snow was up to his knees, above them whenever the ground hollowed
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you?&rdquo; she protested unhappily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      simply kill yourself!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Small loss if I do! But as that would hardly help you out of your
      difficulties, I&rsquo;ve no intention of giving up the ghost just at
      present.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started on again, pressing forward slowly and determinedly, but it was
      only with great difficulty and exertion that he was able to make headway.
      Jean, her cheek against the rough tweed of his coat, could hear the
      labouring beats of his heart as the depth of the snow increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much further?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not far,&rdquo; he answered briefly, husbanding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few more steps. They were both silent now. Jean&rsquo;s eyes sought his
      face. It was ashen, and even in that bitter cold beads of sweat were
      running down it; he was nearing the end of his tether. She could bear it
      no longer. She stirred restlessly in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put me down,&rdquo; she cried imploringly. &ldquo;<i>Please</i> put
      me down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep still, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth.
      She felt his arms tighten round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment he stumbled heavily against some surface root or boulder,
      concealed beneath the snow, and pitched forward, and in the same instant
      Jean felt herself sinking down, down into a soft bed of something that
      yielded resistlessly to her weight. Then came a violent jerk and jar, as
      though she had been seized suddenly round the waist, and the sensation of
      sinking ceased abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay quite still where she had fallen and, looking upwards, found
      herself staring straight into the eyes of the Englishman. He was lying
      flat on his face, on ground a little above the snow-filled hollow into
      which his fall had flung her, his hand grasping the strap which was
      fastened round her body. He had caught the flying end of it as they fell,
      and thus saved her from sinking into seven or eight feet of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice came to her roughened with fierce anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m not hurt. Only don&rsquo;t leave go of your end of
      the strap!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; she heard him mutter. Then, aloud, reassuringly:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got my end of it all right. How, can you catch hold of
      the strap and raise yourself a little so that I can reach you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean obeyed. A minute later she felt his arms about her shoulders,
      underneath her armpits, and then very slowly, but with a sure strength
      that took from her all sense of fear, he drew her safely up beside him on
      to the high ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eor a moment they both rested quietly, recovering their breath. The
      Englishman seemed glad of the respite, and Jean noticed with concern the
      rather drawn look of his face. She thought he must be more played out than
      he cared to acknowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the silence of sheer fatigue their eyes met&mdash;Jean&rsquo;s
      filled with a wistful solicitude as unconscious and candid as a child&rsquo;s,
      the man&rsquo;s curiously brilliant and inscrutable&mdash;and in a moment
      the silence had become something other, different, charged with emotional
      significance, the revealing silence which falls suddenly between a man and
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is what comes of stealing a day from Mrs. Grundy,&rdquo;
      commented the man drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tension was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up, as though, anxious to maintain the recovered atmosphere of
      the commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! Having shot her bolt and tried ineffectually to down you in a
      ditch, I expect the old lady will let us get home safely now. We&rsquo;re
      through the worst. There are no more drifts between here and the hotel.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Anything that might have spelt danger was past, and it only
      remained to follow the beaten track up to the hotel, though even so, with
      the wind and snow driving in their faces, it took them a good half-hour to
      accomplish the task.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur and Madame de Varigny, a distracted <i>maître d&rsquo;hôtel</i>,
      and a little crowd of interested and sympathetic visitors welcomed their
      arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mon dieu, mademoiselle!</i> But we rejoice to see you back!&rdquo;
      exclaimed Madame de Varigny. &ldquo;We ourselves are only newly returned&mdash;and
      that, with difficulty, through this terrible storm&mdash;and we arrive to
      find that none knows where you are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me, I made sure that mademoiselle had accompanied <i>Madame la
      Comtesse.</i>&rdquo; asseverated Monsieur Vautrinot, nervously anxious to
      exculpate himself from any charge of carelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were just going to organise a search-party,&rdquo; added the
      little Count. &ldquo;I, myself&rdquo;&mdash;stoutly&mdash;&ldquo;should
      have joined in the search.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Weary as she was, Jean could hardly refrain from smiling at the idea of
      the diminutive Count in the rôle of gallant preserver. He would have been
      considerably less well-qualified even than herself to cope with the
      drifting snow through which the sheer, dogged strength of the Englishman
      had brought her safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instinctively she turned with the intention of effecting an introduction
      between the latter and the Varignys, only to find that he had disappeared.
      He had taken the opportunity presented by the little ferment of excitement
      which had greeted her safe return to slip away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt oddly disconcerted. And yet, she reflected, it was so like him&mdash;so
      like the conception of him which she had formed, at least&mdash;to evade
      both her thanks and the enthusiasm with which a recital of the afternoon&rsquo;s
      adventure Would have been received.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE MAGIC MOMENT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN, surprisingly
      revived by a hot bath and a hot drink, and comfortably tucked up beside
      the fire in her room, was recounting the day&rsquo;s adventure to Madame
      de Varigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a somewhat expurgated version of the affair that she outlined&mdash;thoughtfully
      calculated to allay the natural apprehensions of a temporary chaperon&mdash;in
      which the unknown Englishman figured innocuously as merely having come to
      her assistance when, in the course of her afternoon&rsquo;s tramp, she had
      been overtaken by the blizzard. Of the stolen day, snatched from under
      Mrs. Grundy&rsquo;s enquiring nose, Jean preserved a discreet silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who he could be,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      never seen him on the ice before; I should certainly have recognised him
      if I had. He was a lean, brown man, very English-looking&mdash;that sort
      of cold-tub-every-morning effect, you know. Oh! And he had one perfectly
      white lock of hair that was distinctly attractive. It looked&rdquo;&mdash;descriptively&mdash;&ldquo;as
      though someone had dabbed a powdered finger on his hair&mdash;just in the
      right place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s eyes narrowed, and a quick ejaculation escaped
      her. It was something more than a mere exclamation connoting interest; it
      held a definitely individual note, as though it sprang from some sudden
      access of personal feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, hearing it, looked up in some surprise, and the other, meeting her
      questioning glance, rushed hastily into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lock of white hair? But how <i>chic!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It should not&rdquo;&mdash;thoughtfully&mdash;&ldquo;be difficult
      to discover the identity of anyone with so distinctive a characteristic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not staying in the hotel, at all events,&rdquo; said Jean.
      &ldquo;He told me he was at a friend&rsquo;s chalet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he did not enlighten you as to his name? Gave you no hint?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny spoke with an assumption of indifference, but there was
      an undertone of suppressed eagerness in her liquid voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head, smiling a little to herself. It had been part of the
      charm of that brief companionship that neither of the two comrades knew
      any of the everyday, commonplace details concerning the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will see him again at the rink to-morrow,&rdquo;
      suggested Madame de Varigny, still with that note of restrained eagerness
      in her tones. &ldquo;The snow is not deep except where it has drifted;
      they will clear the ice in the morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent. She was not altogether sure that she wanted to see him
      again. As it stood, robbed of all the commonplace circumstances of
      convention, the incident held a certain glamour of whimsical romance which
      could not but appeal to the daughter of Glyn Peterson. Nicely rounded off,
      as, for instance, by the unknown Englishman&rsquo;s prosaically calling at
      the hotel the next day to enquire whether she had suffered any ill
      effects, it would lose all the thrill of adventure. It was the suggestion
      of incompleteness which flavoured the entire episode so piquantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, on the whole, Jean rather hoped that she would not meet the Englishman
      again&mdash;at least, not yet. Some day, perhaps, it might be rather nice
      if chance brought them together once more. There would be a certain
      element of romantic fitness about it, should that happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I am likely to see him again,&rdquo; she said
      quietly, replying to Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s suggestion. &ldquo;He told
      me he was going away to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it been conceivable, Jean would have said that a flash of
      disappointment crossed the Countess&rsquo;s face. But there seemed no
      possible reason why the movements of an unknown Englishman should cause
      her any excitation of feeling whatever, pleasant or otherwise. The only
      feasible explanation was that odd little streak of inquisitiveness
      concerning other people&rsquo;s affairs which appeared to be
      characteristic of her and which she had before evinced concerning the
      circumstances of Lady Anne Brennan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever curiosity she may have felt, however, on this occasion Madame de
      Varigny refrained from giving expression to it. Apparently dismissing the
      subject of the Englishman&rsquo;s identity from her mind, she switched the
      conversation into a fresh channel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unfortunate that you should have met with such a contretemps
      to-day. You will not feel disposed to dance this evening, after so much
      fatigue,&rdquo; she observed commiseratingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jean scouted the notion. With the incomparable resiliency of youth,
      she felt quite equal to dancing all night if needs be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais tout au contraire!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      practically recovered&mdash;at least, I shall be after another half-hour&rsquo;s
      lazing by this glorious fire. I wonder what heaven-sent inspiration
      induced Monsieur Vautrinot to install a real English fire-place in this
      room? It&rsquo;s delicious.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess rose, shrugging her expressive shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wonderful&mdash;you English! If it had been I who had
      experienced your adventure to-day, I should be fit for nothing. As to
      dancing the same evening&mdash;<i>ma foi, non! Voyons</i>, I shall leave
      you to rest a little.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded smilingly and left the room. Once in the corridor outside,
      however, the smile vanished as though it had been wiped off her face by an
      unseen hand. Her curving lips settled into a hard, inflexible line, and
      the soft, disarming dark eyes grew suddenly sombre and brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed swiftly along to her own suite. It was empty. The little Count
      was downstairs, agreeably occupied in comparing symptoms with a fellow
      health crank he had discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quick sigh of relief at his absence she flung herself into a chair
      and lit a cigarette, smoking rapidly and exhaling the smoke in quick,
      nervous jerks. The long, pliant fingers which held the cigarette were not
      quite steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Tout va bien!</i>&rdquo; she muttered restlessly. &ldquo;All
      goes well! <i>Assurément</i>, his punishment will come.&rdquo; She bent
      her head. &ldquo;<i>Que Dieu le veuille!</i>&rdquo; she whispered
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean took a final and not altogether displeased survey of herself in the
      mirror before descending to the big <i>salle</i> where the fancy-dress
      ball was to be held. She had had her dinner served to her in her room so
      that she might rest the longer, and now, as there came wafted to her ears
      the preliminary grunts and squeals and snatches of melody of the hotel
      orchestra in process of tuning up, she was conscious of a pleasant glow of
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing strikingly original about the conception of her costume.
      It represented &ldquo;Autumn,&rdquo; and had been designed for a
      fancy-dress ball of more than a year ago&mdash;before the death of
      Jacqueline had suddenly shuttered down all gaiety and mirth at Beirnfels.
      But, simple as it was, it had been carried out by an artist in colour, and
      the filmy diaphanous layers of brown and orange and scarlet, one over the
      other, zoned with a girdle of autumn-tinted leaves, served to emphasise
      the russet of beech-leaf hair and the topaz-gold of hazel eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s glance swept the girl with approval as they
      entered the great <i>salle</i> together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is charming, your costume! <i>Regarde</i>, Henri&rdquo;&mdash;turning
      to the Count, who, as a swashbuckling d&rsquo;Artagnan, was getting into
      difficulties with his sword. &ldquo;Has it not distinction&mdash;this
      costume<i> d&rsquo;automne?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count retrieved himself and, hitching his sword once more into
      position, poured forth an unembarrassed stream of Gallic compliment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny herself was looking supremely handsome as Cleopatra.
      Jean reflected that her eyes,&mdash;slumberous and profound, with their
      dusky frame of lashes and that strange implacability she always sensed in
      them&mdash;might very well have been the eyes of the Egyptian queen
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>salle</i> was filling up rapidly. Jean, who did not anticipate
      dancing overmuch, as she had made but few acquaintances in the hotel,
      watched the colourful, shifting scene with interest. There was the usual
      miscellany of a masquerade&mdash;Pierrots jostling against Kings and
      Cossacks, Marie Antoinettes flaunting their jewels before the eyes of
      demure-faced nuns, with here and there an occasional costume of
      outstanding originality or merit of design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrary to her expectations, however, Jean soon found herself with more
      partners than she had dances to bestow, and, newly emancipated from the
      rigour of her year&rsquo;s mourning, she threw herself into the enjoyment
      of the moment with all the long repressed enthusiasm of her youth.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing the small hours when at last she found herself alone for a
      few minutes. In the exhilaration of rapid movement she had completely
      forgotten the earlier fatigues of the day, but now she was beginning to
      feel conscious of the strain which the morning&rsquo;s skating, followed
      by that long, exhausting struggle through the blizzard, had imposed upon
      even young bones and muscles. Close at hand was a deserted alcove,
      curtained off from the remainder of the <i>salle</i>, and here Jean found
      temporary sanctuary, subsiding thankfully on to a big cushioned divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the orchestra came to her ears pleasantly dulled by the heavy
      folds of the screening curtain. Vaguely she could feel the rhythmic
      pulsing, the sense of movement, in the <i>salle</i> beyond. It was all
      very soothing and reposeful, and she leaned her head against a fat, pink
      satin cushion and dosed, at the back of her mind the faintly disturbing
      thought that she was cutting a Roman senator&rsquo;s dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she stirred a little, hazily aware of some disquiet that was
      pushing itself into her consciousness. The discomfort grew, crystallising
      at last into the feeling that she was no longer alone. Eor a moment,
      physically unwilling to be disturbed, she tried to disregard it, but it
      persisted, and, as though to strengthen it, the recollection of the
      defrauded senator came back to her with increased insistence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broad awake at last, she opened her eyes. Someone&mdash;the senator
      presumably&mdash;was standing at the entrance to the little alcove, and
      she rushed into conscience-stricken speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have I cut your dance? I&rsquo;m so sorry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off abruptly, realising as she spoke that the intruder was not,
      after all, the senator come to claim his dance, but a stranger wearing a
      black mask and domino. She was sure she had not seen him before amongst
      the dancers in the <i>salle</i>, and for a moment she stared at him
      bewildered and even a little frightened. Vague stories she had heard of a
      &ldquo;hold-up&rdquo; by masked men at some fancy-dress ball recalled
      themselves disagreeably to her memory, and her pulse quickened its beat
      perceptibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite suddenly, she knew who it was. It did not need even the
      evidence of that lock of <i>poudré</i> hair above the mask he wore, just
      visible in the dim light of the recess, to tell her. She knew. And with
      the knowledge came a sudden, disturbing sense of shy tumult.
    </p>
    <p>
      She half-rose from the divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo; she stammered nervously. &ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He whipped off his mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else? Did this deceive you?&rdquo;&mdash;dangling the strip of
      velvet from his finger, and regarding her with quizzical grey eyes.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hunting for you everywhere. I&rsquo;d almost made
      up my mind that you had gone to bed like a good little girl. And then my
      patron saint&mdash;or was it the special devil told off to look after me,
      I wonder?&mdash;prompted me to look in here. <i>Et vous voilà,
      mademoiselle!</i> How are you feeling after your exploits in the snow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke very rapidly, in a light half-mocking tone that seemed to Joan to
      make the happenings of the afternoon unreal and remote. His eyes were very
      bright, almost defiant in their expression&mdash;holding a suggestion of
      recklessness, as though he were embarked upon something of which his
      inmost self refused to approve but which he was nevertheless determined to
      carry through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you <i>did</i> &lsquo;call to enquire,&rsquo; after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, Jean&rsquo;s mouth curled up at the corners in an
      involuntary little smile of amused recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I did call after all?&rdquo; He looked puzzled&mdash;not
      unnaturally, since he had no clue to her thoughts. &ldquo;What do you
      mean? I came&rdquo;&mdash;he went on lightly&mdash;&ldquo;because I wanted
      the rest of the day which you promised to share with me. The proceedings
      were cut short rather abruptly this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how did you get here?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;And&mdash;and
      why did you disappear so suddenly after we got back to the hotel this
      afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got here by the aid of a pair of excellent skis and the light of
      the moon; the snow ceased some hours ago and the surface is hardening
      nicely. I disappeared because, as I told you, if you gave me this one day,
      it should bind you to nothing&mdash;not even to introducing me to your
      friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have had to present you as <i>Monsieur l&rsquo;Inconnu,</i>&rdquo;
      remarked Jean without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; He met her glance with smiling eyes, but he did not
      volunteer his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had made no comment, uttered no word beyond the bald affirmative, yet
      somehow Jean felt as though she had committed an indiscretion and he had
      snubbed her for it. The blood rushed into her cheeks, staining them
      scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; she said stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that glint of ironical amusement in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For what, mademoiselle?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a rising indignation at his attitude. She could not
      understand it; he seemed to have completely changed from the man of a few
      hours ago. Then he had proved himself so good a comrade, been so entirely
      delightful in his thought and care of her, whereas now he appeared bent on
      wilfully misunderstanding her, putting her in a false position just for
      his own amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well what I meant,&rdquo; she answered, a tremor
      born of anger and wounded feeling in her voice. &ldquo;You thought I was
      inquisitive&mdash;trying to find out your name&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;humorously&mdash;&ldquo;you were, weren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo; Then, as her lip quivered sensitively, &ldquo;Ah! Forgive me
      for teasing you! And&rdquo;&mdash;more earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;forgive me
      for not telling you my name. It is better&mdash;much better&mdash;that you
      should not know. Remember, we can only have this one day together; we&rsquo;re
      just &lsquo;ships that pass.&rsquo;&rdquo; He paused, then added: &ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s
      only a battered old hulk&mdash;a derelict vessel&mdash;and derelicts are
      best forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an undercurrent of deep sadness in his voice, the steadfast,
      submissive sadness of a man who has long ago substituted endurance for
      revolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, we can only have this one day together.&rdquo; The quiet
      utterance of the words stung Jean into a realisation of their
      significance, and suddenly she was conscious that the knowledge that this
      unknown Englishman was going away&mdash;going out of her life as abruptly
      as he had come into it&mdash;filled her with a quite disproportionate
      sense of regret. She found herself unexpectedly up against the recognition
      of the fact that she would miss him&mdash;that she would like to see him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;you want me to forget?&rdquo; she asked rather
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell away from him as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned gravely. &ldquo;Just that. I want you to
      forget.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you?&rdquo; The words seemed dragged from her without
      her own volition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed a little&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid I&rsquo;m inconsistent. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to give me
      something I can remember. That&rsquo;ll even matters up, if you forget and
      I&mdash;remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want me to give you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a sudden step towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to dance with me&mdash;just once. Will you?&rdquo;&mdash;intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for her reply, his keen, compelling glance fixed on her face.
      Then, as though he read his answer there, he stepped to her side and held
      out his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost as if she were in a dream, Jean laid her hand lightly on his sleeve
      and he pulled aside the portière for her to pass through. Then, putting
      his arm about her, he swung her out on to the smooth floor of the <i>salle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      They danced almost in silence. Somehow the customary small-change of
      ballroom conversation would have seemed irrelevant and apart. This dance&mdash;the
      Englishman had implied as much&mdash;was in the nature of a farewell. It
      was the end of their stolen day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The band was playing <i>Valse Triste</i>, that unearthly, infinitely sad
      vision of Sibelius&rsquo;, and the music seemed to hold all the strange,
      breathless ecstacy, the regret and foreboding of approaching end of which
      this first, and last, dance was compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over at last. The three final chords of the <i>Valse</i>&mdash;inexorable
      Death knocking at the door&mdash;dropped into silence, and with the end of
      the dance uprose the eager hum of gay young voices, as the couples drifted
      out from the <i>salle</i> in search of the buffet or of secluded corners
      in which to &ldquo;sit out&rdquo; the interval, according as the spirit
      moved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean and her partner, making their way through the throng, encountered
      Madame de Varigny on the arm of a handsome Bedouin Arab. For the fraction
      of a second her eyes rested curiously on Jean&rsquo;s partner, and a gleam
      of something that seemed like triumph flickered across her face. But it
      was gone in an instant, and, murmuring some commonplace to Jean, she
      passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman rapped out the question harshly, and Jean was struck by an
      unaccustomed note in his voice. It held apprehension, distaste; she could
      not quite analyse the quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Cleopatra, do you mean?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That was my
      chaperon, the Comtesse de Varigny. Why do you ask?&rdquo; He gave a short,
      relieved laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No particular reason,&rdquo; he returned with some constraint
      &ldquo;She reminded me&mdash;extraordinarily&mdash;of someone I used to
      know, that&rsquo;s all. Even the timbre of her voice was similar. It
      startled me for a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismissed the matter with apparent indifference, and led Jean again
      into the same little alcove in which he had found her. They stood together
      silently in the dim, rose-hued twilight diffused by the shaded lamp above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, slowly, reluctantly. &ldquo;So this
      is really the end of our stolen day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s hands, hanging loosely clasped in front of her, suddenly
      tightened their grip of each other. She felt herself struggling in the
      press of new and incomprehensible emotions. A voice within her was crying
      out rebelliously: &ldquo;Why? Why must it be the end? Why not&mdash;other
      days?&rdquo; Pride alone kept her silent. It was his choice, his decision,
      that they were not to meet again, and if he could so composedly define the
      limits of their acquaintance, she was far too sensitively proud to utter a
      word of protest. After all, he was only the comrade of a day. How&mdash;why
      should it matter to her whether he stayed or went?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always believe&rdquo;&mdash;the Englishman was speaking again,
      his eyes bent on hers&mdash;&ldquo;I always believe that, no matter how
      sad or tragic people&rsquo;s lives may be, God invariably gives them one
      magic moment&mdash;so that they may believe in heaven.... I have had mine
      to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;believe in heaven?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hands lightly on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do now. I believe... in a heaven that is out of my reach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands slipped upward from her shoulders, cupping her face, and for a
      moment he held her so, staring down at her with grave, inscrutable eyes.
      Then, stooping his head, he kissed her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, little comrade,&rdquo; he said unevenly. &ldquo;Thank you
      for my magic moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned away sharply. She heard his step, followed by the quick, jarring
      rattle of brass rings jerked violently along the curtain-pole, and a
      moment later he was gone. With a dull sense of finality she watched the
      heavy folds of the portière swing sullenly back into their place.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII&mdash;WHICH DEALS WITH REFLECTIONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE dawn of a new
      day possesses a curious potency of readjustment. It is as though Dame
      Nature, like some autocratic old nurse, wakes us up and washes and dresses
      our minds afresh for us each morning, so that they come to the renewed
      consideration of the affairs of life freed from the influences and
      emotions which were clogging their pores when we went asleep. Not
      infrequently, in the course of this species of mental ablution, a good
      deal of the glamour which invested the doings of the previous day gets
      scrubbed off, and a new and not altogether pleasing aspect of affairs
      presents itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was somewhat Jean&rsquo;s experience when she woke on the morning
      following that of the fancy-dress ball. Looking back upon the events of
      the previous day, it seemed to her newly-tubbed, matutinal mind almost
      incredible that they should have occurred. It was like a dream&mdash;life
      itself tricked out in fancy dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripped of the glamour of romance and adventure with which the unknown
      Englishman had contrived to clothe it, the whole episode of their day
      together presented itself as disagreeably open to criticism, and the
      memory of that final scene in the alcove sent the blood flying into her
      cheeks. She asked herself in mute amazement how it was possible that such
      a thing should have happened to her,&mdash;to &ldquo;our chaste Diana,&rdquo;
      as her father used laughingly to call her in recognition of the
      instinctive little air of aloofness with which she had been wont to keep
      men at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the Englishman had taken her by surprise, but Jean was too
      honest, even in her dealings with herself, to shelter behind this excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that she had yielded to his kiss&mdash;and knew, too, that the
      bare memory of it sent her heart throbbing in an inexplicable tumult of
      emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stolen day, that day embarked upon so unconcernedly, in a gay spirit
      of adventure, had flamed up at its ending into something altogether
      different from the light-hearted companionship with which it had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her conscience, recreated and vigorous from its morning toilet,
      presented another facet of the affair for her inspection. With officious
      detail it marshalled the whole series of events before her, dwelling
      particularly on the fact that, with hut very slight demur, she had
      consented to abrogate the accepted conventions of her class&mdash;conventions
      designed to safeguard people from just such consequences as had ensued&mdash;and
      winding up triumphantly with the corollary that although, like most men in
      similar circumstances, the Englishman had not scrupled to avail himself of
      the advantages the occasion offered, he had probably, none the less,
      thought rather cheaply of her for permitting him to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      This reflection stung her pride&mdash;exactly as Conscience had intended
      it should, without doubt. Last night there had seemed to her no question
      about the quality of that farewell in the little screened-off alcove.
      There had been nothing common or &ldquo;cheap&rdquo; about it. The
      gathering incidents of the whole day, the fight through the storm, the
      prelude of <i>Valse Triste</i>, all seemed to have led her by
      imperceptible degrees to a point where she and the Englishman could kiss
      at parting without shame. And now, with the morning, the delicate rainbow
      veiling woven by romance was rudely torn asunder, and the word &ldquo;cheap&rdquo;
      dinned in her ears like the clapper of a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appearance of her <i>premier dejeuner</i> came as a web come
      distraction from her thoughts, and with the consumption of <i>café au lait</i>
      and the crisp little rolls, hot from the oven, accompanying it, the whole
      matter began to assume a less heinous aspect. After all, argued Jean&rsquo;s
      weak human nature, the unconventionality of the affair had been
      considerably tempered by the fact that the Englishman had practically
      saved her life during the course of the day. Alone, she would undoubtedly
      have foundered in the drifting snow; and when a man has rescued you from
      an early and unpleasantly chilly grave, it certainly sets the acquaintance
      between you, however short its duration, on a new and more intimate plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, little comrade; thank you for my magic moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words, and the manner of their utterance, came back to Jean, bringing
      with them a warm and comforting reassurance. The man who had thus spoken
      had not thought her cheap; he was too fine in his perceptions to have
      misunderstood like that. She felt suddenly certain of it. And the pendulum
      of self-respect swung back into its place once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she caught herself wondering whether she would see him again
      before she left Montavan. True, he had told her he was going away the next
      day. But had he actually gone? Somewhere within her lurked a fugitive,
      half-formed hope that he might have altered his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to brush the thought aside, refusing to recognise it and
      determinedly maintaining that it mattered nothing to her whether he stayed
      or went. Nevertheless, throughout the whole day&mdash;in the morning when
      she made a pretence of enjoying the skating on the rink, and again in the
      afternoon when she walked through the pine-woods with the Varignys&mdash;she
      was subconsciously alert for any glimpse of the lean, supple figure which
      a single day had sufficed to mate so acutely familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by evening she was driven into accepting the fact that he had quitted
      the mountains, and of a sudden Montavan ceased to interest her; the magic
      that had disguised it yesterday was gone. It had become merely a dull
      little village where she was awaiting Lady Anne Brennan&rsquo;s answer to
      her father&rsquo;s letter, and she grew restlessly impatient for that
      answer to arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came at last, during the afternoon of the following day, in the form of
      a telegram: &ldquo;<i>Delighted to welcome you. Letter follows.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter followed in due course, two days later, the tardiness of its
      arrival accounted for by the fact that the writer had been moving about
      from place to place, and that Peterson&rsquo;s own letter, after pursuing
      her for days, had only just caught up with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot tell you,&rdquo; wrote Lady Anne in her squarish,
      characteristic hand, &ldquo;how delighted I shall be to have the daughter
      of Glyn and Jacqueline with me for a time. Although Glyn with a grown-up
      daughter sounds quite improbable; he never really grew up himself. So you
      must come and convince me that the unexpected has happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean liked the warm-hearted, unconventional tone of the letter, and the
      knowledge that she would so soon be leaving Montavan filled her with a
      sense of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the four days which had elapsed since the Englishman&rsquo;s
      departure her restlessness had grown on her. Montavan had become too
      vividly reminiscent of the hours which they had shared together for her
      peace of mind. She wanted to forget that stolen day&mdash;thrust it away
      into the background of her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately for the success of her efforts in this direction, the
      element of the unknown which surrounded the Englishman, quite apart from
      anything else, would have tended to keep him in the forefront of her mind.
      It was only now, surveying their acquaintance in retrospect, that she
      fully realised how complete had been his reticence. True his figure
      dominated her thoughts, but it was a figure devoid of any background of
      home, or friends, or profession. He might be a king or a crossing-sweeper,
      for all she knew to the contrary&mdash;only that neither the members of
      the one nor the other profession are usually addicted to sojourning at
      Swiss chalets and forming promiscuous friendships on the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments when she felt that she detested this man from nowhere
      who had contrived to break through her feminine guard of aloofness merely
      to gratify his whim to spend a day in her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other moments when the memory of that stolen day glowed and
      pulsed like some rare gem against the even, grey monotony of all the days
      that had preceded it&mdash;and of those which must come after. She could
      not have analysed, even to herself, the emotions it had wakened in her.
      They were too complex, too fluctuating.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As she packed her trunks in preparation for an early start the following
      day, Jean recalled with satisfaction the genuine ring of welcome which had
      sounded through the letter that had come from England. Until she had
      received it, she had been the prey of an increasing diffidence with regard
      to suddenly billeting herself for an indefinite period upon even such an
      old friend of her father&rsquo;s as Lady Anne&mdash;a timidity Peterson
      himself had certainly not shared when he penned his request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give my little girl house-room, will you, Anne?&rdquo; he had
      written with that candid and charming simplicity which had made and kept
      for him a host of friends through all the vicissitudes of his varied and
      irresponsible career. &ldquo;I am off once more on a wander-year, and I
      can&rsquo;t be tripped up by a petticoat&mdash;certainly not my own
      daughter&rsquo;s&mdash;at every yard. This isn&rsquo;t quite as cynical as
      it sounds. You&rsquo;ll understand, I know. Frankly, a man whose life, to
      all intents and purposes, is ended, is not fit company for youth and
      beauty standing palpitating on the edge of the world. By the way, did I
      tell you that Jean is rather beautiful? I forget. Let her see England&mdash;that
      little corner where you live, down Devonshire way, always means England to
      my mind. And let her learn to love Englishwomen&mdash;if there are any
      more there like you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, having accomplished this characteristic, if somewhat; sketchy
      provision for his daughter&rsquo;s welfare, Peterson had gone cheerfully
      on his way, convinced that he had done all that was paternally encumbent
      on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny was voluble in her regrets at the prospect of losing her
      &ldquo;<i>chère Mademoiselle Peterson</i>,&rdquo; yet in spite of her
      protestations of dismay Jean was conscious of an impression that the
      Countess derived some kind of satisfaction from the imminence of her
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not reconcile the contradiction, and it worried her a little.
      She believed&mdash;quite justly&mdash;that Madame de Varigny had conceived
      a real affection for her, and, as far as she herself was concerned, she
      had considerably revised her first impressions of the other, finding more
      to like in her than she had anticipated, noticeably a genuine warmth and
      fervour of nature, and a certain kind-hearted capacity for interesting
      herself in other people.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, liking her so much better than she had at first conceived possible,
      Jean resented the sudden recurrence of her original distrust produced by
      the suggestion of insincerity which she thought she detected in the
      Countess&rsquo;s expressions of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the face of it the thing seemed absurd. She could imagine no
      conceivable reason why her departure should give Madame de Varigny any
      particular cause for complacency, which only made the more perplexing her
      impression that this was the actual feeling underlying the latter&rsquo;s
      cordial interest in her projected visit to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of her departure, Jean&rsquo;s mind was too preoccupied
      with the small details attendant upon starting off on a journey dwell upon
      the matter. But, as she shook bands with Madame de Varigny for the last
      time, the recollection surged over her afresh, and she was strongly
      conscious that beneath the other woman&rsquo;s pleasant, &ldquo;<i>Adieu,
      mademoiselle! Bon voyage!</i>&rdquo; something stirred that was less
      pleasant&mdash;even inimical&mdash;just as some slimy and repulsive form
      of life may stir amid the ooze at the bottom of a sunlit stream.

      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;THE MAN FROM MONTAVAN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN arrived in
      London with a good three hours to spare before the South-Western express,
      by which she proposed to travel to Devonshire, was due to leave Waterloo
      Station. She elected, therefore, to occupy the time by touring round the
      great, unknown city of her dreams in a taxicab, and spent a beatific hour
      glimpsing the Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, and the old, grey, misty
      river that Londoners love, and skirmishing in and out of the shops in
      Regent Street and Bond Street with her hands full of absurd, expensive,
      unnecessary purchases only bought because this was London and she felt she
      just simply <i>must</i> have something English at once, and winding up
      with a spin through Hyde Park&mdash;which didn&rsquo;t impress her very
      favourably in its winter aspect of leafless trees and barren stretches of
      sodden grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she drove to a hotel, and, her luggage deposited there to await her
      departure, her thoughts turned very naturally towards lunch. Her scamper
      round London in the crisp, clear, frosty air had converted the
      recollection of her early morning coffee and roll into something extremely
      nebulous and unsupporting, and it was with the healthy appetite of an
      eager young mind in an eager young body that she faced the several courses
      of the table d&rsquo;hote.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced about her with interest, the little snatches of English
      conversation which drifted to her from other near-by tables giving her a
      patriotic thrill of pure delight. These were typically English people
      lunching in a typically English hotel, and she, hitherto a stranger to her
      own mother-country, was doing likewise. The knowledge filled her with
      ridiculous satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were English people&mdash;at home in their own country&mdash;anything
      like as dull and dowdy as Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s sweeping criticisms had
      led her to expect. The men were immensely well-groomed and clean-looking.
      She liked the &ldquo;morning-tub&rdquo; appearance they all had; it
      reminded her of the Englishman at Montavan. Apparently it was a British
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women, too, filled her with a species of vicarious pride. They were so
      well turned-out, with a slim, long limbed grace of figure she found
      admirable, and with splendid natural complexions&mdash;skins like rose and
      ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of them were drifting into the room together now, with a superbly cool
      assurance of manner&mdash;rather as though they had bought the hotel&mdash;which
      brought the sleek head-waiter automatically to their side, bowing and
      obsequious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat to Jean&rsquo;s satisfaction he convoyed them to the table next
      her own, and she was pleasantly conscious, as they passed her, of a
      provocative whisper of silk and of the faint fragrance of violets subtly
      permeating the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious that perhaps she had been manifesting her interest a little too
      openly, she turned her attention to a magazine she had bought en route
      from Dover and was soon absorbed in the inevitable happy-ever-after
      conclusion of the story she had been reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Anne? Oh, she lives at Staple now. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker&rsquo;s voice was clear and resonant, with the peculiar
      carrying quality which has replaced in the modern Englishwoman of the
      upper classes that excellent thing in woman which was the proud boast of
      an earlier generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conjunction of the familiar words &ldquo;Lady Anne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Staple&rdquo;
      struck sharply on Jean&rsquo;s ears, and almost instinctively she looked
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stirred, one of the women glanced indifferently in her direction,
      then placidly resumed her conversation with her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was just after the smash-up,&rdquo; she pursued glibly. &ldquo;Blaise
      Tormarin rushed off abroad for a time, and the news of Nesta&rsquo;s death
      came while he was away. Poor Lady Anne had to write and tell him of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather ghastly!&rdquo; commented the other woman. &ldquo;I never
      heard the whole story of the affair. I was in Paris, then, and it was all
      over&mdash;barring the general gossip, of course!&mdash;by the time I
      returned. I tried to pump it out of Lady Anne once, but she was as close
      as an oyster.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both women talked without lowering their voices in the slightest degree,
      and with that complete indifference to the proximity of a stranger
      sometimes exhibited by a certain arrogant type.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, realising that it was her father&rsquo;s friends who were under
      discussion, and finding herself forced into the position of an unwilling
      auditor, felt wretchedly uncomfortable. She wished fervently that she
      could in some way arrest the conversation. Yet it was clearly as
      impossible for her to lean forward and say: &ldquo;You are talking about
      the people I am on my way to visit,&rdquo; as it would have been for her
      to put her fingers in her ears. So far nothing had been said to which she
      could actually object. Her feeling was chiefly the offspring of a
      supersensitive fear that she might learn from the lips of these two
      gossiping women, one of whom was apparently intimately acquainted with the
      private history of the Tormarin family, some little fact or detail which
      Lady Anne might not care for her future guest to know. Apart from this
      fear, it would hardly have been compatible with human nature&mdash;certainly
      not feminine human nature&mdash;if she had not felt pricked to
      considerable personal interest in the topic under discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was a fool business,&rdquo; the first woman rejoined,
      settling down to supply the details of the story with an air of rapacious
      satisfaction which reminded Jean of nothing so much as of a dog with a
      bone. &ldquo;Nesta Freyne was a typical Italian&mdash;though her father
      was English, I believe&mdash;all blazing, passionate eyes and blazing,
      passionate emotion, you know; then there was another man&mdash;and there
      was Blaise Tormarin! You can imagine the consequences for yourself. Blaise
      has his full share of the Tormarin temper&mdash;and a Tormarin in a temper
      is like a devil with the bit between his teeth. There were violent
      quarrels and finally the girl bolted, presumably with the other man. Then,
      later, Lady Anne heard that she had died abroad somewhere. The funny thing
      is that it seemed to cut Tormarin up rather badly. He&rsquo;s gloomed
      about the world ever since, so I suppose he must have been pretty deeply
      in love with her before the crash came. I never saw her, but I&rsquo;ve
      been told she was diabolically pretty.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other woman laughed, dismissing the tragedy of the little tale with a
      shallow tinkle of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I&rsquo;ve only met Blaise Tormarin once, but I should
      say he was not the type to relish being thrown over for another man!&rdquo;
      She peered short-sightedly at the grilled fish on her plate, poking at it
      discontentedly with her fork. &ldquo;I never think they cook their fish
      decently here, do you?&rdquo; she complained.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with that, both women shelved the affairs of Blaise Tormarin and
      concentrated upon the variety of culinary sins from which even expensive
      hotel chefs are not necessarily exempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had no time to bestow upon the information which had been thus thrust
      upon her until she had effected the transport of herself and her
      belongings from the hotel to Waterloo Station, but when this had been
      satisfactorily accomplished and she found herself comfortably settled in a
      corner seat of the Plymouth express, her thoughts reverted to her newly
      acquired knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      It added a bit of definite outline to the very slight and shadowy picture
      she had been able to form of her future environment&mdash;a picture
      roughly sketched in her mind from the few hints dropped by her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered a little why Glyn should have omitted all mention of Blaise
      Tormarin&rsquo;s love affair and its unhappy sequel, but a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection supplied the explanation. Peterson had admitted that it was ten
      years since he had heard from Lady Anne; presumably, then, the
      circumstances just recounted in Jean&rsquo;s hearing had occurred during
      those years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt that the additional knowledge she had gained rather detracted
      from the prospective pleasure of her visit to Staple. Judging from the
      comments which she had overheard, her host was likely to prove a somewhat
      morose and gloomy individual, soured by his unfortunate experience of
      feminine fidelity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence her thoughts vaulted wildly ahead. Most probably, as a direct
      consequence, he was a woman-hater and, if so, it was more than possible
      that he would regard her presence at Staple as an unwarrantable intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A decided qualm assailed her, deepening quickly into a settled conviction&mdash;Jean
      was nothing if not thorough!&mdash;that the real explanation of the delay
      in Lady Anne&rsquo;s response to Glyn&rsquo;s letter had lain in Blaise
      Tormarin&rsquo;s objection to the invasion of his home by a strange young
      woman&mdash;an objection Lady Anne had had to overcome, or decide to
      ignore, before she could answer Glyn&rsquo;s request in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea that she might be an unwelcome guest at Staple filled Jean with
      lively consternation, and by the time she had accomplished the necessary
      change of train at Exeter, and found herself being trundled along on the
      leisurely branch line which conducted her to her ultimate destination, she
      had succeeded in working herself up into a condition that almost verged
      upon panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coombe <i>Ea</i>-vie! <i>Coombe</i> Eavie!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sing-song intonation of a depressed-looking porter, first rising from
      a low note to a higher, then descending in contrary motion abruptly from
      high to low, was punctuated by the sharper, clipped pronouncement of the
      stationmaster as he bustled up the length of the platform declaiming:
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Meavie! &rsquo;Meavie! &rsquo;Meavie!&rdquo; with a
      maddeningly insistent repetition that reminded one of a cuckoo in June.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently both stationmaster and porter were too much absorbed in the
      frenzied strophe and antistrophe effect they were producing to observe
      that any passenger, handicapped by luggage, contemplated descending from
      the train&mdash;unexpected arrivals were of rare occurrence at Coombe
      Eavie&mdash;and Jean therefore hastened to transfer herself and her
      hand-baggage to the platform unassisted. A minute later the train ambled
      on its way again, leaving the stationmaster and the depressed porter
      grouped in astonished admiration before the numerous trunks and
      suit-cases, labelled &ldquo;Peterson,&rdquo; which the luggage van of the
      departing train had vomited forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the bucolic mind, such an unwonted accumulation argued a passenger of
      quite superlative importance, and with one accord the combined glances of
      the station staff raked the diminutive platform, to discover Jean standing
      somewhat forlornly in the middle, of it, surrounded by the smaller fry of
      her luggage. The stationmaster hurried forward immediately to do the
      honours, and Jean addressed him eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a <i>fiacre</i>&mdash;cab&rdquo;&mdash;correcting herself
      hastily&mdash;&ldquo;to take me to Staple Manor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no cabs here, miss,&rdquo; he informed her regretfully.
      &ldquo;Anyone that wants to be met orders Wonnacott&rsquo;s wagonette in
      advance.&rdquo; Then, seeing Jean&rsquo;s face lengthen, he continued
      hastily: &ldquo;But if they&rsquo;re expecting you up at Staple, miss,
      they&rsquo;ll be sure to send one of the cars to meet you. There!&rdquo;&mdash;triumphantly,
      as the chug-chug of an approaching motor came to them clearly on the
      crisp, cold air&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;ll be it, for certain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed the sound of a car braking to a standstill in the road outside
      the station, and almost immediately a masculine figure appeared advancing
      rapidly from the lower end of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even through the dusk of the winter&rsquo;s afternoon Jean was struck by
      something curiously familiar in the man&rsquo;s easy, swinging stride. A
      surge of memories came flooding over her, and she felt her breath catch in
      her throat at the sudden possibility which flashed into her mind. For an
      instant she was in doubt&mdash;the thing seemed so amazingly improbable.
      Then, touching his hat, the stationmaster moved respectfully aside, and
      she found herself face to face with the unknown Englishman from Montavan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him speechlessly, and for a moment he, too, seemed taken
      aback. His eyes met hers in a startled, leaping glance of recognition and
      something more, something that set her pulses racing unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Little comrade!</i>&rdquo; She could have sworn the words
      escaped him. Then, almost in the same instant, she saw the old, rather
      weary gravity replace the sudden fire that had blazed up in the man&rsquo;s
      eyes, quenching its light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;<i>you</i> are Miss Peterson!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no pleasure, no welcome in his tones; rather, an undercurrent of
      ironical vexation as though Fate had played some scurvy trick upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The brief monosyllable came baldly in reply; she hardly
      knew how to answer him, how to meet his mood. Then, hastily calling up her
      reserves, she went on lightly: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem very pleased to
      see me. Shall I go away again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His mouth relaxed into a grim smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t Clapham Junction,&rdquo; he answered tersely.
      &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be a train till ten o&rsquo;clock to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A glint of humour danced in Jean&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; she returned gravely, &ldquo;what do you
      advise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t advise,&rdquo; he replied promptly. &ldquo;I
      apologise. Please forgive such an ungracious reception, Miss Peterson&mdash;but
      you must acknowledge it was something in the nature of a surprise to find
      that you were&mdash;you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s given you an unfair advantage, too,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;I still haven&rsquo;t penetrated your incognito&mdash;but I suppose
      you are Mr. Brennan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Nick Brennan&rsquo;s my half-brother. I&rsquo;m Blaise
      Tormarin, and, as my mother was unable to meet you herself, I came
      instead. Shall we go? I&rsquo;ll give the station-master instructions
      about your baggage.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So the unknown Englishman of Montavan was the man of whom the two women at
      the neighbouring lunch table in the hotel had been gossiping&mdash;the
      central figure of that most tragic love-affair! Jean thought she could
      discern, now, the origin of some of those embittered comments he had let
      fall when they were together in the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence she followed him out of the little wayside station to where the
      big head-lamps of a stationary car shed a blaze of light on the roadway,
      and presently they were slipping smoothly along between the high hedges
      which flanked the road on either hand.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE MASTER OF STAPLE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was too dark to
      distinguish details as the big car flew-along, but Jean found herself
      yielding instinctively to the still, mysterious charm of the country-side
      at even.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slender young moon drifted like a curled petal in the dusky blue of the
      calm sky, its pale light faintly outlining the tops of the trees and the
      dim, gracious curves of distant hills, and touching the mist that filled
      the valleys to a nebulous, pearly glimmer, so that to Jean&rsquo;s eager
      eyes the foot of the hills seemed laved by some phantom sea of faery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt no inclination to talk. The smooth rhythm of the pulsing car, the
      chill sweetness of the evening air against her face, the shadowy,
      half-revealed landscape all combined to lull her into a mood of tranquil
      appreciation, aloof and restful after the fatigue of her journey and the
      shock of her unexpected meeting with the Englishman from Montavan. She
      knew that later she would have to take up the thread of things again,
      adjust her mind to the day&rsquo;s surprising developments, but just for
      the moment she was content to let everything else slide and simply enjoy
      this first exquisite revelation of twilit Devon.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time they drove in silence, Tormarin seeming no more disposed
      to talk than she herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, he slowed the car down and, half-turning in his seat,
      addressed her abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is somewhat in the nature of an anti-climax,&rdquo; he
      remarked, the comment quite evidently springing from the thoughts which
      had been absorbing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke curtly, as though he resented the march of events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt herself jolted suddenly out of the placid reverie into which she
      had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It is odd we should meet again so soon,&rdquo; she assented
      hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The silence has been broken&mdash;after all! You may be sure, Miss
      Peterson, it was by no will of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled under cover of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not very complimentary,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      sorry our meeting seems to afford you so little satisfaction.&rdquo; There
      was a ripple of laughter in her tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo; As he spoke, he slackened speed until
      the car was barely moving. &ldquo;You know it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; he
      continued, his voice tense. &ldquo;But, all the same, I&rsquo;m going to
      ask you to&mdash;forget Montavan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s heart gave a violent throb, and the laughter went suddenly
      out of her voice as she repeated blankly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To forget Montavan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please. I said&mdash;and did&mdash;a few mad things that day we
      spent together. It was to be an uncounted day, you know, and&mdash;oh,
      well, the air of the Alps is heady! I want you to forgive me&mdash;and to
      blot out all remembrance of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to speak with some effort, yet each word was uttered
      deliberately, searing its way into her consciousness like red-hot iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curt, difficultly spoken sentences could only signify one thing&mdash;that
      he had meant nothing, not even good, honest comradeship, that day at
      Montavan. He had merely been amusing himself with a girl whom he never
      expected to meet again, and now that circumstances had so unexpectedly
      brought them together he was clearly anxious that she should be under no
      misapprehension in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s pride writhed beneath the insult of it. It was as though he
      feared she might make some claim upon his regard and had hastened to warn
      her, almost in so many words, not to set a fictitious value upon anything
      that had occurred between them. The glamour was indeed torn from her
      stolen day on the mountains! The whole memory of it, above all the memory
      of that pulsing moment of farewell, would henceforth he soiled and
      vulgarised&mdash;converted into a rather sordid little episode which she
      would gladly have blotted out from amongst the concrete happenings of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The feminine instinct against self-betrayal whipped her into quick speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no wish to forget that you practically saved my life,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I shall always&rdquo;&mdash;lightly&mdash;&ldquo;feel
      very much obliged for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate my share in the matter,&rdquo; he replied
      carelessly. &ldquo;You would have extricated yourself from your
      difficulties without my assistance, I have no doubt. Or, more truly&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a short laugh&mdash;&ldquo;you would never have got into them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more, but let out the car and they shot forward into the
      gathering dusk. Presently they approached a pair of massive iron gates
      admitting to the manor drive, and as these were opened in response to a
      shrill hoot from Tormarin&rsquo;s horn the car swung round into an avenue
      of elms, the bare boughs, interlacing overhead, making a black network
      against the moonlit sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still in silence they approached the house, its dim grey bulk, looming
      indeterminately through the evening mist, studded here and there with a
      glowing shield of orange from come unshaded window, and almost before
      Tormarin had pulled up the car, the front door flew open and a wide riband
      of light streamed out from the hall behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was conscious of two or three figures grouped in the open doorway,
      dark against the welcoming blaze of light, then one of them detached
      itself from the group and hastened forward with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are at last!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Jean hesitated, doubtful as to whether the speaker could be
      Lady Anne. The voice which addressed her was so amazingly young&mdash;clear
      and full of vitality like the voice of a girl. Then the light flickered on
      to hair as white as if it had been powdered, and she realized that this
      surprisingly young voice must belong to her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so sorry I could not meet you at the station myself,&rdquo;
      continued Lady Anne, leading the way into the house. &ldquo;But a tiresome
      visitor turned up&mdash;one of those people who never know when it&rsquo;s
      time to go&mdash;and I simply couldn&rsquo;t get away without forcibly
      ejecting her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fuller light of the hall, Jean discerned in Lady Anne&rsquo;s
      appearance something of that same quality of inherent youth apparent in
      her voice. The keen, humorous grey eyes beneath their black, arched brows
      were alertly vivacious, and the quite white hair served to enhance, rather
      than otherwise, the rose-leaf texture of her skin. Many a much younger
      woman had envied Lady Anne her complexion; it was so obviously genuine,
      owing nothing at all to art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&rdquo;&mdash;Jean felt herself pulled gently into the light&mdash;&ldquo;let
      me have a good look at you. Oh, yes!&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Anne laughed
      amusedly&mdash;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s daughter right
      enough&mdash;you have just his chin with that delicious little cleft in
      it. But your eyes and hair are Jacqueline&rsquo;s.&rdquo; She leaned
      forward a little and kissed Jean warmly. &ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;re very
      welcome at Staple. There is nothing I could have wished more than to have
      you here&mdash;except that you could have prevailed upon Glyn to bring you
      himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have quite finished going into the ancestral details of
      Miss Peterson&rsquo;s features, madonna, perhaps you will present me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne laughed good-humouredly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is my pushful younger son, Jean. (I&rsquo;m certainly
      going to call you Jean without asking whether I may!) You&rsquo;ve already
      made acquaintance with Blaise. This is Nick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick Brennan was as unlike his half-brother as he could possibly be&mdash;tall,
      and fair, and blue-eyed, with a perfectly charming smile and an air of not
      having a care in the world. Jean concluded he must resemble closely the
      dead Claude Brennan, since, except for a certain family similarity in cut
      of feature, he bore little resemblance to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise has had an hour&rsquo;s start of me in getting into your
      good graces, Miss Peterson,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands. &ldquo;I
      consider it very unfair, but of course I had to be content&mdash;as usual&mdash;with
      the younger son&rsquo;s portion.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean liked him at once. His merry, lazy blue eyes smiled friendship at
      her, and she felt sure they should get on together. She could not imagine
      Nick &ldquo;glooming&rdquo; about the world, as one of the women at the
      hotel had declared his half-brother did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to her that it would simplify matters if both he and Lady Anne
      were made aware at once of her former meeting with Blaise, so she took the
      opportunity offered by Nick&rsquo;s speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s had more than that,&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;Mr.
      Tor-marin and I had already met before&mdash;at Montavan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Montavan?&rdquo; Lady Anne gave vent to an ejaculation of amused
      impatience. &ldquo;If we had only known! Blaise could have accompanied you
      back and saved you all the bothersome details of the journey. But we had
      no idea where he was. He went off in his usual way&rdquo;&mdash;smiling a
      shade ruefully&mdash;&ldquo;merely condescending to inform his yearning
      family that he was going abroad for a few weeks.&rdquo; Then, as Tormarin,
      having surrendered the car to a chauffeur, joined the group in the hall,
      she turned to him and continued with a faint note of expostulation in her
      voice: &ldquo;You never told us you had already met Miss Peterson, Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it myself till I found her marooned on the
      platform at Coombe Eavie,&rdquo; he returned. His eyes, meeting Jean&rsquo;s,
      flickered with brief amusement as he added nonchalantly: &ldquo;I did not
      catch Miss Peterson&rsquo;s name when we met at Montavan.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we were not formally introduced,&rdquo; supplemented Jean.
      &ldquo;But Mr. Tormarin was obliging enough to pull me out of an
      eight-foot deep snowdrift up in the mountains, so we allowed that to count
      instead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What luck!&rdquo; exclaimed Nick with fervour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was rather,&rdquo; agreed Jean. &ldquo;To be smothered in a
      snowdrift isn&rsquo;t exactly the form of extinction I should choose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I meant luck for Blaise,&rdquo; explained Nick. &ldquo;Opportunities
      of playing knight-errant are few and far between nowadays&rdquo;&mdash;regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all laughed, and then Lady Anne carried Jean off upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she found that a charming bedroom, with a sitting-room connecting,
      had been allotted her&mdash;&ldquo;so that you&rsquo;ll have a den of your
      own to take refuge in when you&rsquo;re tired of us,&rdquo; as Lady Anne
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt touched by the kindly thought. It takes the understanding
      hostess to admit frankly that a guest may sometimes crave for the solitude
      of her own company&mdash;and to see that she can get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms which were to constitute Jean&rsquo;s personal domain were
      delightfully decorated, old-world tapestries and some beautiful old prints
      striking just the right note in conjunction with the waxen-smooth mahogany
      of Chippendale. From the bedroom, where a maid was already busying herself
      unstrapping the traveller&rsquo;s manifold boxes, there opened off a
      white-tiled bathroom frankly and hygienically modern, and here Jean was
      soon splashing joyfully. By the time she had finished her bath and dressed
      for dinner she felt as though the fatigue of the journey had slipped from
      her like an outworn garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere at dinner was charmingly informal, and presently, when the
      meal was at an end, the party of four adjourned into the hall for coffee.
      As Jean&rsquo;s eyes roved round the old-fashioned, raftered place, she
      was conscious of a little intimate thrill of pleasure. With its walls
      panelled in Jacobean oak, and its open hearth where a roaring fire of logs
      sent blue and green flames leaping up into the chimney&rsquo;s cavernous
      mouth, it reminded her of the great dining-hall at Beirnfels. But here
      there was a pleasant air of English cosiness, and it was obvious that at
      Staple the hall had been adopted as a living-room and furnished with an
      eye to comfort. There were wide, cushioned window-seats, and round the
      hearth clustered deep, inviting chairs, while everywhere were the little,
      pleasant, home-like evidences&mdash;an open book flung down here, a piece
      of unfinished needlework there&mdash;of daily use and occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick at once established himself at Jean&rsquo;s side, kindly informing
      her that now that his inner man was satisfied he was prepared to make
      himself agreeable. Upon which Lady Anne apologised for his manners and
      Nick interrupted her, volubly pointing out that the fault, if any (which
      he denied), was entirely hers, since she had been responsible both for his
      upbringing and inherited tendencies. They both talked at once, wrangling
      together with huge zest and enjoyment, and it was easily apparent that the
      two were very close friends indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise took no part in the stream of chatter and nonsense which ensued,
      but stood a little apart, his shoulder propped against the chimney-piece,
      drinking his coffee in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s glance wandered reflectively from one brother to the other.
      They presented a striking contrast&mdash;the stern, dark-browed face of
      the elder man, with its bitter-looking mouth and that strange white streak
      lying like some, ghostly finger-mark across his dark hair, and the
      bubbling, blue-eyed charm of the younger. The difference between them was
      as definite as the difference between sunlight and shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick was full of plans for Jean&rsquo;s entertainment, suggestions for
      boating and tennis occupying a prominent position in the programme he
      sketched out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really quite jolly paddling about on our lake,&rdquo; he
      rattled on. &ldquo;The stream that feeds it hails from Dartmoor, of
      course. All Devonshire streams do, I believe&mdash;at least, you&rsquo;ll
      never hear of one that doesn&rsquo;t, the Moor being our proudest
      possession. Besides, people always believe that your water supply must be
      of crystalline purity if you just casually mention that its source is a
      Dartmoor spring. So of course, we all swear to the Dartmoor origin of our
      domestic waterworks. It sounds well&mdash;even if not always strictly
      true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Peterson must find it a trifle difficult to follow your train
      of thought,&rdquo; commented Blaise a little sharply. &ldquo;A moment ago
      you were discussing boating, and now it sounds as though you&rsquo;ll
      shortly involve yourself&mdash;and us&mdash;in a disquisition upon
      hygiene.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick smiled placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My enthusiasm got away with me a bit,&rdquo; he admitted with
      unruffled calm. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t the least doubt that Miss
      Peterson will like to know these few reassuring particulars. However&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      And he forthwith returned enthusiastically to the prospects of tennis and
      kindred pastimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again Blaise broke in ungraciously. It seemed as though, for some
      reason, Nick&rsquo;s flow of light-hearted nonsense and the dozen
      different plans he was proposing for Jean&rsquo;s future divertisement,
      irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your suggestions seem to me remarkably inept, Nick,&rdquo; he
      observed scathingly, &ldquo;seeing that at present it is midwinter and the
      lake frozen over about a foot deep. Quite conceivably, by the time that
      tennis and boating become practicable, Miss Peterson may not be here. She
      may get tired of us long before the summer comes,&rdquo; he added quickly,
      as though in a belated endeavour to explain away the suggestion of
      inhospitality which might easily be inferred from his previous sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the hasty addition were intended to reassure Jean, it failed of its
      purpose. The idea that her coming to Staple was not particularly
      acceptable to its master had already taken possession, of her. Originally
      the consequence of the conversation she had overheard at the hotel,
      Tormarin&rsquo;s reluctantly given welcome when he met her at Coombe Eavie
      Station had served to increase her feeling of embarrassment And now, this
      last speech, though so hastily qualified, convinced her that her advent
      was regarded by her host in anything but a pleasurable light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t think you must count on me for the tennis
      season, Mr. Brennan,&rdquo; she said quickly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t propose
      to billet myself on you indefinitely, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but I hope you do, my dear,&rdquo; Lady Anne interposed with a
      simple sincerity there was no doubting. &ldquo;You must certainly stay
      with us till your father comes home, and&rdquo;&mdash;with a smile&mdash;&ldquo;unless
      Glyn has altered considerably, I imagine Beirnfels will not see him again
      under a year.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I couldn&rsquo;t possibly foist myself on to you for a year!&rdquo;
      exclaimed Jean. &ldquo;That would be a sheer imposition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne smiled across at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had a daughter&mdash;only
      these two great, unmanageable sons&mdash;and I&rsquo;m just longing to
      play at having one. You&rsquo;re not going to disappoint me, I hope?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something irresistibly winning in Lady Anne&rsquo;s way of
      putting the matter, and Jean jumped up and kissed her impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hate to!&rdquo; she answered warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she evaded giving a direct promise; there must be a clearer
      understanding between herself and Tormarin before she could accept Lady
      Anne&rsquo;s hospitality as frankly and fully as it was offered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity for this clearer understanding came with the entry of
      Baines, the butler, who brought the information that a favourite young
      setter of Nick&rsquo;s had been taken ill and that the stableman feared
      the dog had distemper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick sprang up, his concern showing in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come out and have a look at him,&rdquo; he said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come with you,&rdquo; added Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her hand through his arm, and they hurried off to the stables,
      leaving Blaise and Jean alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment neither spoke. Blaise, smoking a cigarette, remained staring
      sombrely into the fire. Apparently he did not regard it as incumbent on
      him to make conversation, and Jean felt miserably nervous about broaching
      the subject of her visit. At last, however, fear lest Lady Anne and Nick
      should return before she could do so drove her into speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Tormarin,&rdquo; she said quietly&mdash;so quietly that none
      would have guessed the flurry of shyness which underlay her cool little
      voice&mdash;&ldquo;I am very sorry my presence here is so unwelcome to
      you. I&rsquo;m afraid you will have to put up with me for a week or two,
      but I promise you I will try to make other arrangements as soon as I can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards her abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask what you mean?&rdquo; he demanded. It was evident from
      the haughty, almost arrogant tone of his voice that something had aroused
      his anger, though whether it was the irritation consequent upon her
      presence there, or because he chose to take her speech as censuring his
      attitude, Jean was unable to determine. His eyes were stormy and inwardly
      she quailed a little beneath their glance; outwardly, however, she
      retained her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my meaning is perfectly clear,&rdquo; she returned with
      spirit. &ldquo;Even at the station you made it quite evident that my
      appearance came upon you in the light of an unpleasant surprise. And&mdash;from
      what you said just now to Mr. Brennan&mdash;it is obvious you hope my
      visit will not be a long one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had anticipated spurring him into an impulsive disclaimer, she was
      disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry I have failed so lamentably in my duties as host,&rdquo;
      he said coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apology, uttered with such an entire lack of ardour, served to
      emphasise the offence for which it professed to ask pardon. Jean&rsquo;s
      face whitened. She would hardly have felt more hurt and astonished if he
      had struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began. Then stopped, finding her
      voice unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had heard the break in the low, shaken tones, and in a moment his
      mood of intolerant anger vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; he said remorsefully&mdash;and there was genuine
      contrition in his voice now. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a cross-grained fellow, Miss
      Peterson; you&rsquo;ll find that out before you&rsquo;ve been here many
      days. But never think that you are unwelcome at Staple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she stammered.
      She found his sudden changes of humour bewildering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled down at her, that rare, strangely sweet smile of his which when
      it came always seemed to transform his face, obliterating the harsh
      sternness of its lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t quite understand, either,&rdquo; he said
      gently. &ldquo;Only I know it would have been better if you had never come
      to Staple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;you wish I hadn&rsquo;t come?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;slowly. &ldquo;I think I do wish that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that why you were angry&mdash;because I&rsquo;ve come here? Lady
      Anne and&mdash;and Mr. Brennan seemed quite pleased,&rdquo; she added as
      though in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt. Nick, lucky devil, has no need to economise in magic
      moments.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt her cheeks flush under the look he bent upon her, but she forced
      herself to meet it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you?&rdquo; she questioned very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&rdquo;&mdash;briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before sleep visited Jean that night The events of the day
      marched processionally through her mind, and her thoughts persisted in
      clustering round the baffling, incomprehensible personality of Blaise
      Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      His extreme bitterness of speech she ascribed to the unfortunate episode
      that lay in his past. But she could find no reason for his strange,
      expressed wish to disregard their former meeting at Montavan&mdash;to wipe
      out, as it were, all recollection of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That he did not dislike her she felt sure; and a woman rarely makes a
      mistake over a man&rsquo;s personal attitude towards her. But for some
      reason, it seemed to her, he was <i>afraid</i> to let himself like her! It
      was as though he were anxious to bolt and bar the door against any
      possibility of friendship between them. From whichever way she looked at
      it, she could find no key to the mystery of his behaviour. It was
      inexplicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one thing emerged from the confusion of thought; the lost glamour of
      that night at Montavan had returned&mdash;returned with fresh impulse and
      persuasiveness. And when at last she fell asleep, it was with the
      beseeching, soul-haunting melody of <i>Valse Triste</i> crying in her
      ears.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;OTHER PEOPLE&rsquo;S TROUBLES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN woke to find
      the chill, wintry sunlight thrusting in long fingers through the space
      between the casements and the edges of the window-blinds. At first the
      unfamiliar look of a strange bedroom puzzled her, and she lay blinking
      drowsily at the wavering slits of light, wondering in vague, half-awake
      fashion where she was. Gradually, however, recollection returned to her,
      and with it a lively curiosity to view Staple by daylight. She jumped out
      of bed and, rattling up the blinds on their rollers, peered out of the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a hard frost abroad, and the stillness which reigned over the
      ice-bound country-side reminded her of the big Alpine silences. But here
      there was no snow&mdash;no dazzling sheet of whiteness spread, with cold,
      grey-blue shadows flung across it Green and shaven the lawns sloped gently
      down from a flagged terrace, running immediately beneath her window, to
      the very rim of the frozen lake that gleamed in the valley below. Beyond
      the valley, scattered woods and copses climbed the hillside opposite,
      leafless and bare save where a cluster of tall pines towered in evergreen
      defiance against the slate of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the farther distance, beyond the confines of the manor park itself,
      Jean could catch glimpses of cultivated fields&mdash;the red Devon soil
      glowing jewel-like through filmy wisps of morning mist that still hung in
      the atmosphere, dispersing slowly as though loth to go. Here and there a
      little spiral of denser, blue-grey smoke wreathed its way upwards from the
      chimney of some thatched cottage or farmhouse. And back of it all,
      adumbrated in a dim, mysterious purple, the great tors of Dartmoor rose
      sentinel upon the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s glance narrowed down to the sloping sward in front of the
      house. It was all just as her father had pictured it to her. On the left,
      a giant cedar broke the velvet smoothness of mown grass, its gnarled arms
      rimmed with hoar-frost, whilst to the right a tall yew hedge, clipped into
      huge, grotesque resemblances of birds and beasts, divided the lawns from a
      path which skirted a walled rose garden. By craning her neck and almost
      flattening her nose against the window-pane, she could just make out a
      sunk lawn in the rose garden, and in its centre the slender pillar of an
      ancient sundial.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all very English and old-fashioned, breathing the inalienable charm
      of places that have been well loved and tended by successive generations.
      And over all, hills and valleys, park and woodland, lay that faint, almost
      imperceptible humid veil wherewith, be it in scorching summer sunshine or
      iron frost, the West Country tenderly contrives to soften every harsh
      outline into something gracious, and melting, and alluring.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean, familiarised from childhood with the piercing clarity of
      atmosphere, the brilliant colouring and the definiteness of silhouette of
      southern Europe and of Egypt, there was something inexpressibly restful
      and appealing in those blurred hues of grey and violet, in the warm red of
      the Devon earth, with its tender overtone of purple like the bloom on a
      grape, and the rounded breasts of green-clad hills curving suavely one
      into the other till they merged into the ultimate, rock-crowned slopes of
      the brooding moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to love your England,&rdquo; she told Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were making their way down to the lake&mdash;alone together, since
      Blaise had curtly refused to join them&mdash;and as she spoke, Nick
      stopped and regarded her consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather imagine England will love you,&rdquo; he replied, adding,
      with the whimsical impudence which was somehow always permitted Nick
      Brennan: &ldquo;If it were not for a prior claim, I&rsquo;m certain I
      should have loved you in about five minutes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I happened too late,&rdquo; retorted Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can still be a brother to you,&rdquo; he pursued, ignoring
      her interpolation. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo;&mdash;reflectively&mdash;&ldquo;I
      shall like being a brother to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should expect a brother to fetch and carry,&rdquo; cautioned
      Jean. &ldquo;And to make himself generally useful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got the character from my last place about me at
      the moment, but I&rsquo;ll write it out for you when we get back.
      Meanwhile, I will perform the menial task of fastening on your skates.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the lake by now. It was a wide stretch of water several
      acres in extent, and rimmed about its banks with rush and alder. At the
      far end Jean could discern a boat-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be an ideal place for boating in the summer,&rdquo; she
      said, taking in the size of the lake appreciatively as together they
      circled it with long, sweeping strokes, hands interlocked. It was much
      larger than it had appeared from her bedroom window, when it had been
      partially screened from her view by rising ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right just for paddling about,&rdquo; answered Nick.
      &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s really jolly boating on our river. That&rsquo;s
      over on the west side of the park&rdquo;&mdash;he pointed in the direction
      indicated. &ldquo;It divides Staple from Willow Ferry&mdash;the property
      of our next-door neighbour, so to speak. You&rsquo;d like the boating
      here,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;m afraid our skating
      possibilities aren&rsquo;t likely to impress anyone coming straight from
      Switzerland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shall like skating&mdash;or anything else&mdash;here,&rdquo;
      said Jean Warmly. &ldquo;It is all so beautiful. I suppose Devonshire is
      really quite the loveliest county in England? My father always declared it
      was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>We</i> think so,&rdquo; replied Nick modestly. &ldquo;Though a
      Cornishman would probably want to knock me down for saying so! But I love
      it.&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere else I would care to
      live.&rdquo; His eyes softened, seeming almost to caress the surrounding
      fields and woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded. &ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Although
      I&rsquo;ve only been here a few hours, I&rsquo;m beginning to love it,
      too. I don&rsquo;t know why it is&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain it&mdash;but
      I feel as if I&rsquo;d <i>come home</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have. The Petersons lived here for generations.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&rdquo;&mdash;Jean stared at him in astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you mean that they lived at Coombe Eavie?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Didn&rsquo;t you know? They used to own Charnwood&mdash;a
      place about a mile from here. It was sold after your grandfather&rsquo;s
      death. Did your father never tell you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He always avoided speaking of anything in connection with his life
      over here. I think he hated England. Is there anyone living at Charnwood
      now?&rdquo; she asked, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It has changed hands several times, and now a friend of ours
      lives there&mdash;Lady Latimer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps I shall be able to go there some day. I should like to
      see the place where my father&rsquo;s people lived&rdquo;&mdash;eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the true Devonshire homing instinct,&rdquo; he
      declared. &ldquo;Devon folk who&rsquo;ve left the country always want to
      see the &lsquo;place where their people lived.&rsquo; I remember, about a
      year ago, a Canadian girl and her brother turned up at Staple. They were
      descendants of a Tormarin who had emigrated two or three generations
      before, and they had come across to England for a visit. Their first trip
      was to Devonshire; they wanted to see &lsquo;the place where Dad&rsquo;s
      people had lived.&rsquo; And, by Jove, they knew a lot more about it than
      we did! They were posted up in every detail, and insisted on a personally
      conducted tour over the whole place. They went back to Canada rejoicing,
      loaded with photographs of Staple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it was rather dear of them to come back like that,&rdquo;
      she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swung round the head of the lake and, as they turned, Jean caught
      sight of a woman&rsquo;s figure emerging from the path which ran through
      the woods. Apparently the newcomer descried the skaters at the same
      moment, for she stopped and waved her hand in a friendly little gesture of
      greeting. Nick lifted his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Lady Latimer,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in his voice, some indescribable deepening of quality, made Jean
      look at him quickly. She remembered on one occasion, in a jeweller&rsquo;s
      shop, noticing a very beautiful opal lying in its case; she had commented
      on it casually, and the man behind the counter had lifted it from its
      satiny bed and turned it so that the light should fall full upon it. In an
      instant the red fire slumbering in its heart had waked into glowing life,
      irradiating the whole stone with pulsing colour. It was some such
      vitalising change as this that she sensed in the suddenly eager face
      beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastening their pace, she and Nick skated up to the edge of the lake where
      Lady Latimer awaited them, and as he introduced the two women to each
      other it seemed as though the eyes of the woman on the bank asked hastily,
      almost frightenedly: &ldquo;Will you prove friend or foe?&rdquo; And Jean&rsquo;s
      eyes, all soft and luminous like every real woman&rsquo;s in the presence
      of love, signalled back steadily: &ldquo;Friend!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claire!&rdquo; said Nick. And Jean thought that no name could have
      suited her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the slenderest thing, with about her the pliant, delicate grace of
      a harebell. Ash-blonde hair, so fair that in some lights it looked silver
      rather than gold, framed the charming Greuze face. Only it was not quite a
      Greuze, Jean reflected. There was too much character in it&mdash;a certain
      gentle firmness, something curiously still and patient in the closing of
      the curved lips, and a deeper appeal than that of mere wondering youth in
      the gentian-blue eyes. They were woman&rsquo;s eyes, eyes out of which no
      weeping could quite wash the wistfulness of some past or present sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are one of the Charnwood Petersons?&rdquo; said Lady Latimer
      in her soft, pretty voice. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t like me, I&rsquo;m
      afraid&rdquo;&mdash;smiling&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m living in your old
      home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jean won&rsquo;t quarrel with you over that,&rdquo; put in
      Nick. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got a splendacious castle all her own somewhere
      in the wilds of Europe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Beirnfels is really my home. I&rsquo;ve never even seen
      Charnwood,&rdquo; smiled Jean. &ldquo;But I should like to&mdash;some day,
      if you will ask me over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, certainly you must come,&rdquo; replied Lady Latimer a
      little breathlessly. But she seemed unaccountably flurried, as though Jean&rsquo;s
      suggestion in some way disquieted her. &ldquo;But of course, Charnwood&mdash;now&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
      a bit like what it must have been when the Petersons had it. I think a
      place changes with the people who inhabit it, don&rsquo;t you? I mean,
      their influence impresses itself on it. If they are good and happy people,
      you can feel it in the atmosphere of the place, and if they are people
      with bad and wicked thoughts, you feel that, too. I know I do.&rdquo; And
      there was no doubt in the mind of either of her hearers that she was
      referring to the last-named set of influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think Charnwood must be lovely, since it&rsquo;s your home
      now,&rdquo; said Jean sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;of course&mdash;it is my home now.&rdquo; Lady
      Latimer looked troubled. &ldquo;But other people live&mdash;have lived
      there. It&rsquo;s changed hands several times, hasn&rsquo;t it, Nick?&rdquo;&mdash;turning
      to him for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick was frowning. He, too, appeared troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s changed hands&mdash;heaps of times,&rdquo; he
      replied gruffly. &ldquo;But I should think your influence would be enough
      to counteract that of&mdash;of everybody else. Look here, chuck discussing
      rotten, psychic influences, Claire, and come on the ice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she replied hastily. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      my skates here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. We&rsquo;ve a dozen pairs up at the
      house. One of them is sure to fit you. I&rsquo;ll go and collect a few.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled as though to cross the lake on his proposed errand, but Claire
      Latimer laid her hand quickly on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t skate this morning. I&rsquo;m
      on my way home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, change your mind!&rdquo; begged Jean, noticing with friendly
      amusement Nick&rsquo;s expression of discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really I can&rsquo;t&rdquo; Claire&rsquo;s face had whitened
      and her big eyes sought Nick&rsquo;s in a kind of pathetic appeal. &ldquo;Adrian
      is not&mdash;very well to-day. My husband,&rdquo; she added explanatorily
      to Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter was conscious of a sense of shock. She had quite imagined Lady
      Latimer to be a widow, and had been mentally engaged in weaving the most
      charming and happy-ever-after of romances since the moment she had seen
      that wonderful change come over Nick&rsquo;s face. Probably her impression
      was due to the manner of his first introduction of Claire&rsquo;s name,
      &ldquo;A friend of ours lives there&mdash;Lady Latimer,&rdquo; without
      reference to any husband lurking in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      She observed that Nick made no further effort to persuade Claire to
      remain, and after exchanging a few commonplace remarks the latter
      continued her way back to Charnwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so nearly lunch time that it did not seem worth while resuming
      their skating. Besides, with Claire Latimer&rsquo;s refusal to join them,
      the occupation seemed to have lost some of its charm, and when Jean
      suggested a return to the house Nick assented readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very sweet&mdash;young Lady Latimer,&rdquo; remarked
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, as they walked back over the frostily crisp turf. &ldquo;But she
      looks rather sad. And she isn&rsquo;t the kind of person one associates
      with sadness. There&rsquo;s something so young and fresh about her; she
      makes one think of spring flowers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick&rsquo;s face kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s like that, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; he answered
      eagerly. &ldquo;Like a pale golden narcissus.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on in silence for a few minutes, the thoughts of each of them
      dwelling on the woman who had just left them. Then Jean said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the &lsquo;prior claim?&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he acknowledged simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never mentioned that she had a husband concealed somewhere. I
      quite thought she was a widow till she suddenly mentioned him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never think of him as her husband&rdquo;&mdash;shortly. &ldquo;You
      can&rsquo;t mate light and darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s an invalid?&rdquo; ventured Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rick&rsquo;s face darkened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a drug fiend,&rdquo; he said in a low, hard voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that one breathless exclamation of horror Jean remained silent. The
      swift picture conjured up before her eyes by Rick&rsquo;s terse speech was
      unspeakably revolting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years ago she had heard her father describing the effect of the drug habit
      upon a friend of his own who had yielded to it. He had been telling her
      mother about it, characteristically oblivious of the presence of a child
      of eleven in the room at the time, and some of Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s
      poignant, illuminating phrases, punctuated by little, stricken murmurs of
      pity from Jacqueline, had impressed a painfully accurate picture on the
      plastic mind of childhood. Ever since then, drug-mania had represented to
      Jean the uttermost abyss.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, the vision of that slender, gracious woman, Rick&rsquo;s &ldquo;pale
      golden narcissus,&rdquo; tied for life to a man who must ultimately become
      that which Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s friend had become, filled her with
      compassionate dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was easy enough, now, to comprehend Claire Latimer&rsquo;s curious lack
      of warmth when Jean expressed the hope that she might go over to Charnwood
      some day. It sprang from the nervous shrinking of a woman at the prospect
      of being driven to unveil before fresh eyes the secret misery and
      degradation of her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was still silent as she and Nick re-entered the hall at Staple. It
      was empty, and as, by common consent, they instinctively drew towards the
      fire Nick pulled forward one of the big easy-chairs for her. Then he stood
      gloomily staring down into the leaping flames, much as Tormarin had stood
      the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intuitively she knew that he wanted to give her his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it, Nick,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I?&rdquo; The words jerked out like a sigh of relief. He
      dropped into a chair beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t very much to tell you. Only, I&rsquo;d like you
      to know&mdash;to be a pal to her, if you can, Jean.&rdquo; He paused, then
      went on quickly: &ldquo;They married her to him when she was hardly more
      than a child&mdash;barely seventeen. She&rsquo;s only nineteen now. Sir
      Adrian is practically a millionaire, and Claire&rsquo;s father and mother
      were in low water&mdash;trying to cut a dash in society on nothing a year.
      So&mdash;they sold Claire. Sir Adrian paid their debts and agreed to make
      them a handsome allowance. And they let her go to him, knowing, then, that
      he had already begun to take drugs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>How could they?</i>&rdquo; burst from Jean in a strangled
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick nodded. His eyes, meeting hers, had lost their gay good humour and
      were dull and lack-lustre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;d wonder how, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he said.
      His voice rasped a little. &ldquo;Still&mdash;they did it. Then, later on,
      the Latimers came to Charnwood, and Claire and I met. It didn&rsquo;t take
      long to love her&mdash;you can understand that, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nick&mdash;yes! She is so altogether lovable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But understand this, too,&rdquo;&mdash;and the sudden sternness
      that gripped his speech reminded her sharply of his brother&mdash;&ldquo;we
      recognise that that is all there can ever be between us. Just the
      knowledge that we love each other. I think even that helps to make her
      life&mdash;more bearable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell silent, and presently Jean stretched out a small, friendly hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for telling me, Nick,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps
      some day you&rsquo;ll be happy&mdash;together. You and Claire. It sounds a
      horrible thing to say&mdash;to count on&mdash;I know, but a man who takes
      drugs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick interrupted her with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t count on Latimer&rsquo;s snuffing out, if that&rsquo;s
      what you mean. He is an immensely strong man&mdash;like a piece of steel
      wire. It will take years for any drug to kill him. I sometimes think&rdquo;&mdash;bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      it will kill Claire first.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI&mdash;&ldquo;THE SINS OF THE FATHERS&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> FEW days later,
      Jean, coming in from a long tramp across country in company with Nick and
      half a dozen dogs of various breeds, discovered Tormarin lounging in a
      chair by the fire. He was in riding kit, having just returned from
      visiting an outlying corner of the estates where his bailiff had suggested
      that a new plantation might be made, and Jean eyed his long supple figure
      with secret approval. Like most well-built Englishmen, he looked his best
      in kit that demanded the donning of breeches and leggings.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fine rain was falling out of doors, and beads of moisture clung to Jean&rsquo;s
      clothes and sparkled in the blown tendrils of russet hair which had
      escaped from beneath the little turban hat she was wearing. Apparently,
      however, her appearance did not rouse Tormarin to any reciprocal
      appreciation, for, after bestowing the briefest of glances upon her as she
      entered, he averted his eyes, concentrating his attention upon the misty
      ribands of smoke that drifted upwards from his cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean knelt down on the hearth, and, pulling off her rain-soaked gloves,
      held out her hands to the fire&rsquo;s cheerful blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good-bye to all the skating, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo;
      she said regretfully. &ldquo;Nick says we&rsquo;re not likely to have
      another hard frost like the last, now that the weather has broken so
      completely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s April next month&mdash;supposedly springtime, you
      know,&rdquo; returned Blaise indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed disinclined to talk, and Jean eyed him contemplatively. His
      attitude towards her baffled her as much as ever. He was unfailingly
      courteous and considerate, but he remained, nevertheless, unmistakably
      aloof, avoiding her whenever it was politely possible, and when it was
      not, treating her with a cool neutrality of manner that was as complete a
      contrast to his demeanour when they were together at Montavan as could
      well be imagined. Indeed, sometimes Jean almost wondered if the events of
      that day they spent amid the snows had really taken place&mdash;they
      seemed so far away, so entirely unrelated to her present life,
      notwithstanding the fact that she was in daily contact with the man who
      had shared them with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was rather uncomplimentary of you not to come skating with us a
      solitary <i>once</i>,&rdquo; she remarked at last, an accent of reproach
      in her voice. &ldquo;Was my performance on the rink at Montavan so
      execrable that you felt you couldn&rsquo;t risk it again?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up, his glance meeting hers levelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve phrased it excellently,&rdquo; he replied briefly.
      &ldquo;I felt I couldn&rsquo;t risk it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flush mounted to Jean&rsquo;s face. There was no misunderstanding
      the significance that underlay the curt words, which, as she was vibrantly
      aware, bore no relation whatever to her skill, or absence of it, on the
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise made no endeavour to relieve the awkward silence that ensued.
      Instead, his eyes rested upon her with a somewhat quizzical expression, as
      though he were rather entertained than otherwise by her evident confusion.
      Jean felt her indignation rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate that other people are not so&mdash;nervous,&rdquo;
      she said disdainfully. &ldquo;Otherwise I should find myself as isolated
      as a fever hospital.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate indeed,&rdquo; he agreed politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the three weeks which had elapsed since her arrival at
      Staple, Jean had dared several similar passages-at-arms with her host.
      Woman-like, she was bent on getting behind his guard of reticence, on
      forcing him into an explanation of his altered attitude towards her&mdash;since
      no woman can be expected to endure that a man should completely change
      from ill-suppressed ardour to a cool, impersonal detachment of manner,
      without aching to know the reason why! But in every instance Tormarin had
      carried off the honours of war, parrying her small thrusts with a lazy
      insouciance which she found galling in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto she had encountered little difficulty in getting pretty much her
      own way with the men of her acquaintance; she had sufficient of the
      temperament and charm of the red-haired type to compass that. But her
      efforts to elucidate the cause of the change in Blaise Tormarin were about
      as prolific of result as the efforts of a butterfly at stone-breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for the preservation of peace, at this juncture there came the
      sound of voices, and Lady Anne entered the room, accompanied by a visitor.
      Her clever, grey eyes flashed quickly from Jean&rsquo;s flushed face to
      that of her son, but, if she sensed the electricity in the atmosphere, she
      made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise, my dear, here is Judith,&rdquo; she said pleasantly.
      &ldquo;I found her wandering forlornly in the lanes, so I drove her back
      here. She has just returned from town, and for some reason her car wasn&rsquo;t
      at the station to meet her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wired home saying what time I should reach Coombe Eavie,&rdquo;
      explained the new-comer. &ldquo;But as I was rather late reaching
      Waterloo, I rashly entrusted the wire to a small boy to send off for me,
      and I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s played me false. I should have had to
      trudge the whole way back to Willow Ferry if Lady Anne hadn&rsquo;t
      happened along.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne turned to Jean, and, laying an affectionate hand on her arm,
      drew her forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean, let me introduce you to Mrs. Craig. My new acquisition,
      Judith, she went on contentedly. A daughter. I always told you I wanted
      one. Now I&rsquo;ve borrowed someone else&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean found herself shaking hands with a slender, distinctive-looking woman
      who moved with a slow, languorous grace that was almost snake-like in its
      peculiar suppleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave one the impression that she had no bones in her body, or that if
      she had, they had never hardened properly but still retained the
      pliability of cartilage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was somewhat sallow&mdash;the consequence, it transpired later, of
      long residence in India&mdash;with sullen, slate-coloured eyes, appearing
      almost purple in shadow, and a straight, thin-lipped mouth. Jean decided
      that she was not in the least pretty, though attractive in an odd, feline
      way, and that she must be about thirty-two. As a matter of fact, Judith
      Craig was forty, but no one would have guessed it&mdash;and she would
      certainly not have confided it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Nick, who had been personally supervising the feeding of his
      beloved dogs, joined the party, greeting Mrs. Craig with the easy
      informality of an old friend, and shortly afterwards Baines brought in the
      tea-things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is Burke?&rdquo; enquired Blaise, of Mrs. Craig, as he
      handed her tea. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he come back with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey? Oh, no. He&rsquo;s not coming down till the end of April.
      You know he detests Willow Ferry in the winter&mdash;&lsquo;beastly wet
      swamp,&rsquo; he calls it! He&rsquo;s dividing his time between London and
      Leicestershire&mdash;London, while that long frost stopped all hunting.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Craig was evidently on a footing of long-established intimacy with
      the Staple household, and Jean, listening quietly to the interchange of
      news and of little personal happenings, regarded her with rather critical
      interest. She was not altogether sure that she liked her, but she was
      quite sure that, wherever her lot might be cast, Judith Craig would never
      occupy the position of a nonentity. She had considerable charm of manner,
      and there was a quite unexpected fascination about her smile&mdash;unexpected,
      because, when in repose, her thin lips lay folded together in a straight
      and somewhat forbidding line, whereas the moment they relaxed into a smile
      they assumed the most delightful curves, and two little lines, which
      should have been dimples but were not, cleft each cheek on either side of
      the mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Mrs. Craig turned to Jean as though she had made up her mind
      about something over which she had been hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I seen you anywhere before?&rdquo; she asked, her charming
      smile softening the abruptness of the question. &ldquo;Your face is so
      extraordinarily familiar.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
      I should remember you if we had met anywhere. Besides, I&rsquo;ve lived
      abroad all my life; this is only my first visit to England.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I can explain,&rdquo; said Lady Anne. There was a
      deliberateness about her manner that suggested she was about to make a
      statement which she was aware would be of some special interest to at
      least one of the party. &ldquo;Jean is Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s daughter; so
      of course you see a likeness, Judith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, glancing enquiringly across at Mrs. Craig, was startled at the
      sudden change in her face produced by Lady Anne&rsquo;s simple
      announcement. The sallow skin seemed to pale&mdash;almost wither, like a
      cut flower that needs water&mdash;and the lips that had been parted in a
      smile stiffened slowly into their accustomed straight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s voice sounded flat and
      she swallowed once or twice before she spoke&mdash;&ldquo;that must be it.
      I&mdash;knew your father, Miss Peterson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean, always sensitive to the emotional quality of the atmosphere, it
      seemed as though some current of hostility, of malevolence, leapt at her
      through the innocent-sounding speech. &ldquo;<i>I knew your father</i>.&rdquo;
      It was quite ridiculous, of course, but the words sounded almost like a
      threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had no answer ready, and a brief silence followed. Then Lady Anne
      bridged the awkward moment with some commonplace, adroitly steering the
      conversation into smoother waters, and a few minutes later Mrs. Craig rose
      to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you across the park, Judith,&rdquo; volunteered
      Nick, and he and his mother accompanied her out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall, Lady Anne detained her visitor an instant with a light hand
      on her arm, while Nick foraged for his own particular headgear, amongst
      the family assortment of hats and caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean is a dear girl, Judith,&rdquo; she said earnestly. &ldquo;I
      want you to be friends with her. Don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;pleadingly&mdash;&ldquo;visit
      the sins of the fathers on the children.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no, I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Craig, with
      apparent frankness. &ldquo;It was only that, for the moment, it was rather
      a shock to learn that she was&mdash;that woman&rsquo;s&mdash;child.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was,&rdquo; acquiesced Lady Anne. &ldquo;Good-bye,
      dear Judith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But notwithstanding Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s assurances, a troubled look
      lingered in Lady Anne&rsquo;s grey eyes long after her guest&rsquo;s
      departure.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;A SENSE OF DUTY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN was immensely
      puzzled at the abrupt change which had occurred in Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s
      manner immediately upon hearing that she was the daughter of Glyn
      Peterson, and, as soon as the visitor had taken her departure, she sought
      an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth made Mrs. Craig freeze up the instant my father&rsquo;s
      name was mentioned? Did she hate him for any reason?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin looked across at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t hate him.
      She loved him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at him in frank astonishment. She had never dreamed that there
      had been any other woman than Jacqueline in Glyn&rsquo;s life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Craig&mdash;and my father?&rdquo; she exclaimed incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t Mrs. Craig in those days. She was Judith Burke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; persisted Jean, determined to get to
      the bottom of the mystery. &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see why.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why what?&rdquo;&mdash;unwillingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why she looked as if she loathed the very sight of me. That&rsquo;s
      not&rdquo;&mdash;drily&mdash;&ldquo;quite the effect you would expect love
      to produce!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curiously abstracted look in Tormarin&rsquo;s eyes as he made
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love is productive of very curious effects on occasion. More
      particularly when it is without hope of fulfilment,&rdquo; he added in a
      lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose my father couldn&rsquo;t help not falling in love
      with Mrs. Craig,&rdquo; protested Jean with some warmth. &ldquo;Nor could
      he have prevented her caring for him. And it&rsquo;s certainly illogical
      of her to feel any resentment towards me on that score. <i>I</i> had
      nothing to do with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love and logic have precious little to say to each other, as a
      rule,&rdquo; replied Tormarin grimly. &ldquo;To Judith, you&rsquo;re the
      child of the woman who stole her lover away from her, so you can hardly
      expect her to feel an overwhelming affection for you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The woman who stole her lover away from her?&rdquo; repeated Jean
      slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand. What do you mean, Blaise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her in some surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely&mdash;&mdash; Don&rsquo;t you know the circumstances?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I simply don&rsquo;t know in the least what you are talking
      about. Please tell me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin made no response for a moment. He was standing with his back to
      the light, but as he lit a cigarette the flare of the match revealed a
      worried expression on his face, as though he deprecated the turn the
      conversation was taking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said at last, evading the point at issue,
      &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all ancient history now. Let it go. There&rsquo;s never
      anything gained by digging up the dry bones of the past.&rdquo; Jean&rsquo;s
      mouth set itself in a mutinous line of determination. &ldquo;Please tell
      me, Blaise,&rdquo; she reiterated. &ldquo;As it is something which
      concerns my father and a woman I shall probably be meeting fairly often in
      the future, I think I have a right to know about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shrugged his shoulders resignedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;if you insist. But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll
      be any happier for knowing.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;Still inflexible?&rdquo;
      She bent her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite&rdquo;&mdash;firmly&mdash;&ldquo;whatever it is, I&rsquo;d
      rather know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On your own head be it, then.&rdquo; He seemed trying to infuse a
      lighter element into the conversation, as though hoping to minimise the
      effect of what he had to tell her. &ldquo;It was just this&mdash;that your
      father and Judith Burke were engaged to be married at the time he met your
      mother, and that&mdash;well, to make a long story short, he ran away with
      Miss Mavory on the day fixed for his wedding with Judith.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dead silence followed the disclosure. Then Jean uttered a low cry of
      dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father did that? Are you sure?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin could see that the story had distressed her. Her eyes showed hurt
      and bewildered like those of a child who has met with a totally unexpected
      rebuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it like that!&rdquo; he urged hastily. &ldquo;After
      all, It was nothing so terrible. You look as though he had broken every
      one of the ten commandments&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled back rather wanly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should worry very much if he had&mdash;in
      some circumstances. But&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;it was so cruel,
      so horribly selfish!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to remember two things in justification&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Justification?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;expressively. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t
      any. There couldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, excuse, then, if you like. One thing is that Jacqueline
      Mavory was one of the most beautiful of women, and the other, that your
      father&rsquo;s engagement to Judith had really been more or less
      engineered by their respective parents&mdash;adjoining properties, friends
      of long standing, and so on. It was no love-match&mdash;on his side.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But on her wedding-day!&rdquo;&mdash;pitifully. &ldquo;Oh! Poor
      Judith!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin smiled a trifle cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the root of the trouble. It was Judith&rsquo;s pride that
      was hurt&mdash;as well as her heart. She married Major Craig not long
      after, and I believe they were really fond of one another and
      comparatively happy. But she has never forgiven Peterson from that day to
      this. And you, being Jacqueline Mavory&rsquo;s daughter, will come in for
      the residue of her bitterness. Unless&rdquo;&mdash;ironically&mdash;&ldquo;you
      can make friends with her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall try to,&rdquo; said Jean simply. &ldquo;Is Major Craig
      living now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. He died out in India, and after his death Judith came back to
      England. She has lived at Willow Ferry with her brother, Geoffrey Burke,
      ever since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, while Jean tried to fit in the new facts she had
      learned with her knowledge of her father&rsquo;s character. She was a
      little afraid that Tormarin might misunderstand her impulsive outburst of
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I am sitting in judgment on my father,&rdquo;
      she said at last. &ldquo;In a way, I can&mdash;even understand his doing
      such a thing. You know, for the last two years of my mother&rsquo;s life I
      was with them both constantly, and anyone living with them could
      understand their doing all kinds of things that ordinary people wouldn&rsquo;t
      do.&rdquo; She paused, as though seeking words that might make her meaning
      clearer. &ldquo;They would never really mean to hurt anyone, but they were
      just like a couple of children together&mdash;gloriously irresponsible and
      happy. I always felt years older than either of them. Glyn used to say I
      was &lsquo;cursed with a damnable sense of duty&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;laughing
      rather ruefully. &ldquo;I suppose I am. Probably I inherit it from our old
      Puritan ancestors on the Peterson side. I know I couldn&rsquo;t have
      cheerfully run off and taken my happiness at the cost of someone else&rsquo;s
      prior right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of extreme bitterness crossed Tormarin&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you&rsquo;re tempted,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;Wait
      till <i>what you want</i> wars against what you ought to have&mdash;what
      you&rsquo;ve the right to take.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she made no answer. Put bluntly like that, the matter
      suddenly presented itself to her as one of the poignant possibilities of
      life. Supposing&mdash;supposing such a choice should ever be demanded of
      her? She felt a vague fear catch at her heart, an indefinable dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she spoke, the eyes she lifted to meet Tor-marin&rsquo;s were
      troubled. In them he could read the innate honesty which was prepared to
      face the question he had raised, and behind that&mdash;courage. A young,
      untried courage, not sure of itself, it is true, but still courage that
      only waited till some call should wake it into fighting actuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she said with a wistful humility that was rather
      touching, &ldquo;I hope I should stick it out One&rsquo;s ideals, and
      duty, and other people&rsquo;s rights&mdash;it would be horrible to scrap
      the lot&mdash;just for love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worth it, perhaps. You&rdquo;&mdash;his voice was the least bit
      uneven&mdash;&ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t been up against love&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she was conscious of that little catch at her heart&mdash;the same
      convulsive tightening of the muscles as one experiences when a telegram is
      put into one&rsquo;s hand which may, or may not, contain bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been up against love yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words recalled her knowledge of the tragic episode that lay in
      Tormarin&rsquo;s own past. The whole history she did not know&mdash;only
      the odds and ends of gossip which one woman had confided to another. But
      here, in the man&rsquo;s curt brevity of speech, surely lay proof that he
      had suffered. And if he had suffered, it followed that he must have cared
      deeply for the woman who had thrown him aside for the sake of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s first generous impulse of pity as she realised this was
      strangely intermingled with a fleeting disquiet, a subconscious sense of
      loss. It was only momentary, and not definite enough for her to express in
      words, even to herself&mdash;hardly more than the slightly blank sensation
      produced upon anyone sitting in the sunshine when a cloud suddenly
      intervenes and drops a shadow where a moment before there has been warmth
      and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later it was overborne by her spontaneous sympathy for the man
      beside her, and, recognising the rather painful similarity between her
      father&rsquo;s treatment of Judith Craig and the story she had heard of
      the unknown woman&rsquo;s treatment of Tormarin himself, she tactfully
      deflected the conversation to something that would touch him less closely,
      launching into a description of the life her parents had led at Beirnfels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were wonderfully happy together there. Not in the least&mdash;as
      I suppose they ought to have been&mdash;an awful example of poetic
      justice!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Glyn used to call Beirnfels his
      &lsquo;House of Dreams-Come-True&rsquo;.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glyn?&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly remarking her use of Peterson&rsquo;s
      Christian name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never called them father and mother. They would have loathed it.
      Glyn used to say that anything which savoured so much of domesticity would
      kill romance!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds like all that I have ever heard about him,&rdquo; said
      Tormarin, smiling too. &ldquo;So does the &lsquo;House of
      Dreams-Come-True.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a charming idea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He took it from one of Jacqueline&rsquo;s songs. She had a glorious
      voice, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so I&rsquo;ve heard. I suppose you have inherited it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I wish I had. But Jacqueline insisted on trying to teach me
      singing, all the same. Poor dear! I was a dreadful disappointment to her,
      I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you sing the &lsquo;House of Dreams&rsquo; song? I&rsquo;m
      rather curious to hear the remainder of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rose and crossed to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can sing you that. Jacqueline always used to say it was
      the only thing I sang as if I understood it, and Glyn declared it was
      because it agreed with my &lsquo;confounded principles&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him as her fingers slid into the prelude of the song, but
      her little joke against herself brought no answering smile to his lips.
      Instead, he stood waiting for the song to begin with an odd kind of
      expectancy on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had most certainly not inherited her mother&rsquo;s exquisite voice,
      but she had a quaint little pipe of her own, with a clouded, husky quality
      in it that was not without its appeal. It lent a wistful charm to the
      simple words of the song. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"It&rsquo;s a
      strange road leads to the House of Dreams, <br /><span class="indent20">To
      the House of Dreams-Come-True, <br /><span class="indent15">Its Hills are
      steep and its valleys deep, <br /><span class="indent15">And salt with
      tears the Wayfarers weep, <br /><span class="indent20">The Wayfarers&mdash;I
      and you. <br /><br /><span class="indent15">"But there&rsquo;s sure a way to
      the House of Dreams, <br /><span class="indent20">To the House of
      Dreams-Come-True. <br /><span class="indent15">We shall find it yet, ere
      the sun has set, <br /><span class="indent15">If we fare straight on, come
      fine, come wet, <br /><span class="indent20">Wayfarers&mdash;I and you.&rdquo;
      </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft, husky voice ceased, and for a moment there was silence. Then
      Tormarin said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I don&rsquo;t think your mother need have felt any great
      disappointment concerning your voice. It has its own qualities, even if it
      is not suited to the concert hall.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the words of the song?&rdquo; questioned Jean eagerly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
      you like them?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty enough idea.&rdquo; He laid a faint,
      significant stress on the last word. &ldquo;But for some of us the &lsquo;House
      of Dreams-Come-True&rsquo; has never been built. Or, if it has, we&rsquo;ve
      lost the way there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of rigid acceptance in his voice, as though he no longer
      strove against the decisions of destiny, and Jean&rsquo;s eager sympathy
      leaped impulsively to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she began. Then checked herself,
      flushing a little. &ldquo;I hate to hear you speak in that way,&rdquo; she
      went on more quietly. &ldquo;It sounds as though there were nothing worth
      trying for&mdash;worth waiting for. I like to believe that everyone has a
      house of dreams which may &lsquo;come true&rsquo; some day.&rdquo; She
      paused. &ldquo;&lsquo;If we fare straight on, come fine, come wet,&rsquo;&rdquo;
      she repeated softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes had a far-away look in them, as though they were envisioning that
      narrow, winding track which leads, somewhen, to the place where dreams
      even the most wonderful of them&mdash;shall become realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorious faith and optimism of youth! If we could only recapture it in
      those after years, when time has added tolerance and a little wisdom to
      our harvest&rsquo;s store, the houses where dreams come true might add
      themselves together until there were whole streets of them&mdash;glowing
      townships&mdash;instead of merely an isolated dwelling here or there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Tormarin listened to Jean&rsquo;s young, eager voice, his face softened
      and some of the tired lines in it seemed to smooth themselves out &ldquo;Little
      Comrade,&rdquo; he said gently, and she felt her breath quicken as he
      called her again by the name which he had used at Montavan&mdash;and once
      since, when they had come suddenly face to face at Coombe Eavie Station.
      But that second time the words had escaped him unawares. Now he was using
      them deliberately, withholding no part of their significance. &ldquo;Little
      comrade, I think the man who &lsquo;fares straight on&rsquo; with you for
      fellow-traveller <i>will</i> find the House of Dreams-Come-True. But it
      isn&rsquo;t&mdash;just any man who may start that journey with you. It
      mustn&rsquo;t be&rdquo;&mdash;his grave eyes held hers intently&mdash;&ldquo;a
      man who has tried to find the road once before&mdash;and failed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Jean that, as he spoke, the wall which he had built up
      between them since she came to Staple crumbled away. This was the same man
      she had known at Montavan, whose hands reached out to hers across some
      fixed dividing line which neither he nor she might pass. She knew now what
      that dividing line must be&mdash;the shadow flung by a past love, his love
      for Nesta Freyne which had ended in hopeless tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must always be a limit set to any friendship of theirs. So much he
      had implied at their first meeting. But, since then, he had taken even
      that friendship from her, substituting a deliberate indifference against
      which she had struggled in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, without knowing quite how it had come about, the barrier was
      down. They were comrades once more&mdash;she and the Englishman from
      Montavan&mdash;and she was conscious of a great content that it should be
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment she asked nothing more, was unconscious of any further
      wish. The woman in her still slumbered, and, to the girl, this friendship
      seemed enough. She did not realise that something deeper, more imperative
      in its ultimate demands, was mingled with it&mdash;was, indeed,
      unrecognised by her, the very essence of it.

      CHAPTER XIII&mdash;&ldquo;WILL YOU WALK INTO MY PARLOUR?&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN, sculling
      leisurely down the river which ran between Staple and Willow Eerry, looked
      around her with a little thrill of enjoyment&mdash;the sheer, physical
      thrill of youth unconsciously in harmony with the climbing sap in the
      trees, with the upward thrust of young green, with all the exquisite
      recreation of Nature in the spring of the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      April had been, as it too commonly is in this northern clime of ours, the
      merest travesty of spring, a bleak, cold month of penetrating wind and
      sleet, but now May had stolen upon the world almost unawares, opening with
      tender, insistent fingers the sticky brown buds fast curled against the
      nipping winds, and misting all the woods with a shimmer of translucent
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overhead arched a sky of veiled, opalescent blue, and Jean, staring up at
      it with dreamy eyes, was reminded of the &ldquo;great city&rdquo; of the
      Book of Revelation whose &ldquo;third foundation&rdquo; was of chalcedony.
      This soft English sky must be the third foundation, she decided
      whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the occupation of sky-gazing did not combine well with that of
      steering a straight course down a stream whose width hardly entitled it to
      its local designation of &ldquo;the river,&rdquo; and a few minutes later
      the boat&rsquo;s nose cannoned abruptly against the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, however, to tie up somewhere under the trees which edged the water had
      been Jean&rsquo;s original intention, this did not trouble her overmuch,
      and discovering a gnarled stump convenient to her purpose, she looped the
      painter round it, collected the rug and a couple of cushions which she had
      brought with her, and established herself comfortably in the stern of the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone else at Staple having engagements of one sort or another, she had
      promised herself a lazy afternoon in company with the latest novel sent
      down from Mudie&rsquo;s. But she was in no immediate hurry to begin its
      pages. The mellow warmth of the afternoon tempted her to the more restful
      occupation of mere day-dreaming, and as she lay tucked up snugly amongst
      her cushions, enjoying the sweet-scented airs that played among the trees
      and over the surface of the water, she allowed her thoughts to drift idly
      back across the two months she had spent at Staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had slipped by so quickly that it was hard to believe that rather
      more than eight weeks had elapsed since that grey February evening when
      she had alighted on the little, deserted platform at Coombe Eavie Station.
      They had been quiet, happy weeks, filled with the pleasant building up of
      new friendships, and Jean reflected that she had already grown to look
      upon Staple almost as &ldquo;home.&rdquo; She possessed in a large measure
      the capacity to adapt herself to her surroundings, and realising that Lady
      Anne had been perfectly sincere in her expressed desire to play at having
      a daughter, Jean had, at first a little tentatively, but afterwards,
      encouraged by Lady Anne&rsquo;s obvious delight, with more assurance,
      gradually assumed the duties that would naturally fall to the daughter of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day she had discovered an increasing pleasure and significance in
      their performance. They were like so many tiny links knitting her life
      into the lives of those around her, and already Lady Anne had begun to
      turn to her instinctively in the small difficulties and necessities which,
      one way or another, most days bring in their train. Jean appreciated this
      as only a girl who had counted for very little in the lives of those
      nearest her could do. It seemed to make her &ldquo;belong&rdquo; in a way
      in which she had never &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; at Beirnfels. There, Glyn
      and Jacqueline had turned to each other for counsel in the little daily
      vicissitudes of life equally as in its larger concerns, and Jean had
      learned to regard herself as more or less outside their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had one letter from Peterson since her arrival at Staple, a brief,
      characteristic note in which he expressed the hope that she liked England
      &ldquo;better than her father ever could&rdquo; but suggested that if she
      were bored she should return to Beirnfels, and ask some woman friend to
      stay with her; he warned her not to expect further letters from him for
      some time to come as, according to his present plans&mdash;of which he
      volunteered no particulars&mdash;he expected to spend the next few months
      &ldquo;as far from civilisation as the restricted size of this world
      permits.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With this letter it seemed to Jean as though the last link with her former
      life had snapped. She felt no regret. Beirnfels, and the unconventional,
      rather exotic life she had led there&mdash;dictated by her parents&rsquo;
      whims and the practically unlimited wealth to gratify them which Peterson&rsquo;s
      flair for successful speculation had achieved&mdash;seemed very far away,
      and Staple, with its peaceful, even-flowing English life, very near and
      enfolding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first visit to Charnwood had been a disappointment. Under changing
      ownerships, little now remained to remind her of the generations of
      Petersons who had lived there long ago. Such of the old pieces of
      furniture and china as Peterson had not considered worth transferring to
      Beirnfels at his father&rsquo;s death had been bought by the next owners
      of the place, and had been taken away by them when they, in their turn,
      disposed of the property. Only a great square stone remained, sunk into
      one of the walls and bearing the Peterson coat of arms and the family
      motto: <i>Omnia debeo Deo</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Adrian Latimer had translated the words to Jean, with a cynical gleam
      in his heavy-lidded eyes and accompanying the translation by a caustic
      reference to her father. The drug had not so far dulled his intellect. On
      the contrary, it seemed to have had the opposite effect of endowing him
      with an almost uncanny insight into people&rsquo;s minds, so that he could
      prick them on a sensitive spot with unerring accuracy and a diabolical
      enjoyment of the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s sympathy for his wife was boundless. A great affection had
      sprung up between the two girls, and bit by bit Claire had drawn aside the
      veil of reticence, letting the other see into the arid, bitter places of
      her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean could understand, now, of what Claire had been thinking on the
      occasion of their first meeting, when she had spoken of the influences of
      the people who inhabit a house. The whole atmosphere of Charnwood seemed
      permeated with the influence of Adrian Latimer&mdash;a grey, sinister,
      unwholesome influence, like the miasma which rises from some poisonous
      swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hell upon earth which he contrived to make of life for his young wife
      had been a revelation to Jean, accustomed as she had been to the exquisite
      love and tenderness with which her father had surrounded Jacqueline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Adrian&rsquo;s chief pleasure in life seemed to be to thwart and
      humiliate his wife in every possible way, and once, in an access of
      indignation over some small refinement of cruelty of which he had been
      guilty, Jean had declared her intention of giving him her frank opinion of
      his behaviour. She had never forgotten the look of bitter amusement with
      which Claire had greeted the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what would happen? He would listen to you with the
      utmost politeness, and very likely let you think you had impressed him.
      But afterwards he would <i>make me pay</i>&mdash;for a day, or a week, or
      a month. Till his revenge was satisfied. And he would put an end to our
      friendship&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Jean had interrupted impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t he? You don&rsquo;t know Adrian.... And I can&rsquo;t
      afford to lose you, Jean. You&rsquo;re one of my few comforts in life.
      Promise me&rdquo;&mdash;she caught Jean&rsquo;s hands in hers and held
      them tightly&mdash;&ldquo;<i>promise me</i> that you will do nothing&mdash;that
      you won&rsquo;t try to interfere? I can generally manage; him&mdash;more
      or less. And when I can&rsquo;t, why, I have to put up with the
      consequences of my own bad management&rdquo;&mdash;with a smile that was
      more sad than tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort of will Jean tried to banish the recollection of Sir Adrian
      from her thoughts. The picture of his thin, leaden-hued face, with its
      cruel mouth and furtive, suspicious eyes, was out of harmony with this
      soft day of spring. She wished she had not let the thought of him intrude
      upon her pleasant reverie at all. His sinister figure seemed to cast a
      shadow over the sunlit river, a shadow which grew bigger and bigger,
      blurring the green of the trees and the sky&rsquo;s faint blue, and even
      silencing the comfortable little chirrups of the birds, busy with their
      spring housekeeping. At least, Jean couldn&rsquo;t hear them any longer,
      and she took no notice even when one enterprising young cock-bird hopped
      near enough to filch a feather that was sticking out invitingly from the
      corner of the cushion behind her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing she was conscious of was of sitting up with great
      suddenness, under the impression that she had overslept and that the
      housemaid was calling to her very loudly to waken her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone <i>was</i> calling&mdash;shouting lustily, in fact, and collecting
      her sleep-bemused faculties, she realised that instead of being securely
      moored against the bank her boat was rocking gently in mid-stream, and
      that the occupant of another boat, coming from the opposite direction, was
      doing his indignant best to attract her attention, since just at that
      point the river was too narrow for them to pass one another unless each
      pulled well in towards the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean reached hastily for her sculls, only to find, to her intense
      astonishment, that they had vanished as completely as though they had
      never existed. She cast a rapid glance of dismay around her, scanning the
      surface of the water in her vicinity for any trace of them. But there was
      none. She was floating serenely down the middle of the stream, perfectly
      helpless to pull out of the way of the oncoming boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile its occupant was calling out instructions&mdash;tempering his
      wrath with an irritable kind of politeness as he perceived that the fool
      whose craft blocked the way was of the feminine persuasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull in a bit, please. We can&rsquo;t pass here if you don&rsquo;t....
      Pull in!&rdquo; he yelled rather more irately as Jean&rsquo;s boat still
      remained in the middle of the river, drifting placidly towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung up her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i> I cant!</i>&rdquo; she shouted back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my
      sculls!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost your sculls?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tones sufficiently implied
      what he thought of the proceeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of strokes, and, gripping the gunwale of her boat as he drew
      level, he steadied it to a standstill alongside his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s eyes travelled swiftly from the squarish, muscular-looking
      hand that gripped the boat&rsquo;s side to the face of its owner. He was
      decidedly an ugly man as far as features were concerned, with a
      dogged-looking chin and a conquering beak of a nose that jutted out
      arrogantly from his hatchet face. The sunlight glinted on a crop of
      reddish-brown hair, springing crisply from the scalp in a way that
      suggested immense vitality; Jean had an idea that it would give out tiny
      crackling sounds if it were brushed hard. His eyebrows, frowning in
      defence against the sun, were of the same warm hue as his hair and very
      thick; in later life they would probably develop into the bristling,
      pent-house variety. The eyes themselves, as Jean described them on a later
      occasion, were &ldquo;too red to be brown&rdquo;; an artist would have had
      to make extensive use of burnt sienna pigment in portraying them.
      Altogether, he was not a particularly attractive-looking individual&mdash;and
      just now the red-brown eyes were fixed on Jean in a rather uncompromising
      glare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How on earth did you lose your oars?&rdquo; he demanded&mdash;as
      indignantly as though she had done it on purpose, she commented inwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips twitched in the endeavour to suppress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I tied
      up under some trees further up and&mdash;and I suppose I must have fallen
      asleep. But still that doesn&rsquo;t explain how I came to be adrift like
      this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s knot, I expect,&rdquo; he vouchsafed rather
      scornfully. &ldquo;A woman never ties up properly. Probably you just
      looped the painter round any old thing and trusted to Providence that it
      would stay looped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave vent to a low laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;ve described the process quite accurately,&rdquo;
      she admitted. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve done the same thing before without any
      evil consequences. There&rsquo;s hardly any current here, you know. I don&rsquo;t
      believe&rdquo;&mdash;with conviction&mdash;&ldquo;that my loop could have
      unlooped itself. And anyway&rdquo;&mdash;triumphantly&mdash;&ldquo;the
      sculls couldn&rsquo;t have jumped out of the boat without assistance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled, revealing strong white teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not. I fancy&rdquo;&mdash;the smile broadening&mdash;&ldquo;some
      small boy must have spotted you asleep in the boat and, finding the
      opportunity too good to be resisted, removed your tackle and set you
      adrift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sympathetic twinkle in his eyes, and Jean, suddenly sensing
      the &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; in him which lurks in every grown-up man,
      flashed back:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that&rsquo;s exactly what you would have done yourself in
      your urchin days!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is,&rdquo; he acknowledged, laughing outright. &ldquo;Well,
      the only thing to do now is for me to tow you back. Where do you want to
      go&mdash;up or down the river?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up, please. I want to get back to Staple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw a quick glance at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you must be Miss Peterson?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How did you guess?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister, Mrs. Craig, told me a Miss Peterson was staying at
      Staple. It wasn&rsquo;t very difficult, after that, to put two and two
      together.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must be Geoffrey Burke?&rdquo; returned Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. So now that we know each other, will you come
      into my parlour?&rdquo;&mdash;smiling. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to take
      you back, there seems no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t accomplish the
      journey together and tow your boat behind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand to steady her as she stepped lightly from one boat to
      the other, and soon they were gliding smoothly upstream, the empty craft
      tailing along in their wake.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while Burke sculled in silence, and Jean leant back, idly watching
      the effortless, rhythmic swing of his body as he bent to his oars. His
      shirt was open at the throat, revealing the strong, broad-based neck, and
      she noticed in a detached fashion that small, fine hairs covered his bared
      arms with a golden down, even encroaching on to the backs of the brown,
      muscular hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself femininely conscious that the most dominant quality
      about the man was his sheer virility. Nor was it just a matter of
      appearances. It lay in something more fundamental than merely externals.
      She had known men of great physical strength to be not infrequently gifted
      with an almost feminine gentleness of nature, yet she was sure this latter
      element played but a small part in the make-up of Geoffrey Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The absolute ease with which he sent the boat shearing through the water
      seemed to her in some way typical. It conveyed a sense of mastery that was
      unquestionable, even a little overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt certain that he was, above and before all other things, primeval
      male, forceful and conquering, of the type who in a different age would
      have cheerfully bludgeoned his way through any and every obstacle that
      stood between him and the woman he had chosen as his mate&mdash;and,
      afterwards, if necessary, bludgeoned the lady herself into submission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you tied up, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s voice broke suddenly across her thoughts, and she looked
      round, recognising the place where she had moored her boat earlier in the
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you divine that?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t require much divination! There are your sculls&rdquo;&mdash;pointing&mdash;&ldquo;stuck
      up against the trunk of a tree&mdash;and looking as though they might
      topple over at any moment. I fancy&rdquo;&mdash;with a smile&mdash;&ldquo;that
      my &lsquo;small boy&rsquo; theory was correct. I believe I could even put
      a name to the particular limb of Satan responsible,&rdquo; he went on.
      &ldquo;You moored your boat on the Willow Perry side of the stream, and
      our lodge-keeper&rsquo;s kids are a troop of young demons. They want a
      thorough good thrashing, and I&rsquo;ll see that they get it before they
      are much older.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled in to the shore and rescuing the sculls from their precarious
      position, restored them to the empty boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he added, as, a few minutes later, he helped
      Jean out on to the little wooden landing-place at Staple, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m
      rather grateful to the small boy&mdash;whoever he may be!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and retorted impertinently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m very grateful to the bigger boy who came
      to the rescue.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something quite unconsciously provocative about her as she stood
      there with one foot poised on the planking, her head thrown back a trifle
      to meet his glance, and a hint of gentle raillery tilting the corners of
      her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cave-man woke suddenly in him. He was conscious of an almost
      irresistible impulse to take her in his arms and kiss her. But the
      conventions of the centuries held, and all Jean knew of that swift
      flare-up of desire in the man beside her was that the grip of his hand on
      hers suddenly tightened so that the pain of it almost made her cry out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And because she was not given to regarding every unmarried man she met in
      the light of a potential lover&mdash;as some women are prone to do&mdash;and
      because, perhaps, her thoughts were subconsciously preoccupied by a lean,
      dark face, rather stern and weary-looking as though from some past
      discipline of pain, Jean never ascribed that fierce pressure of the hand
      to its rightful origin, but merely rubbed her bruised fingers
      surreptitously and wished ruefully that men were not quite so muscular.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you up to the house,&rdquo; remarked Burke,
      without any elaboration of &ldquo;by your leave.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was privately of the opinion that her leave would have little or
      nothing to do with the matter. If this exceedingly autocratic and
      masculine individual had decided to accompany her through the park,
      accompany her he would, and she might as well make the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was extraordinarily unlike his sister, she thought. Where Judith Craig
      would probably seek to attain her ends in a somewhat stealthy, cat-like
      fashion, Burke would employ the methods of the club and battering-ram. Of
      the two, perhaps these last were preferable, since they at least left you
      knowing what you were up against.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come in?&rdquo; asked Jean, pausing as they reached the
      house. &ldquo;Though I&rsquo;m afraid everyone is out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; he replied promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
      much rather have tea alone with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not very polite to the others&rdquo;&mdash;smiling a
      little. &ldquo;I thought the Staple people were old friends of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they are. That&rsquo;s exactly it. I feel the mood of the
      explorer on me this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re one of the people with a penchant for new
      acquaintances, then?&rdquo; she said indifferently, leading the way into
      the hall, where, in place of the great log fire of chillier days, a hank
      of growing tulips made a glory of gold and orange and red in the wide
      hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; he returned bluntly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve
      every intention of making your acquaintance right now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rang the bell and ordered tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think perhaps I might be consulted in the matter,&rdquo; she
      returned lightly when Baines had left the room. &ldquo;The settling of
      questions of that kind is usually considered a woman&rsquo;s prerogative.
      Supposing&rdquo;&mdash;smiling&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you to tea,
      after all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a smouldering fire in the glance he bestowed upon her vivid
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t make a bit of difference&mdash;in the long run,&rdquo;
      he replied deliberately. &ldquo;If a man makes up his mind he can usually
      get his own way&mdash;over most things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t force friendship,&rdquo; she said quickly. It was
      as though she were defying something that threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again that queer gleam showed for a moment in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friendship? No, perhaps not,&rdquo; he conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more and an uncomfortable silence fell between them. Jean was
      suddenly conscious that it might be possible to be a little afraid of this
      man. She did not like that side of him&mdash;the self-willed, masterful
      side&mdash;of which, almost deliberately, he had just given her a glimpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the appearance of tea the slight sense of tension vanished, and the
      conversation dropped into more ordinary channels. She discovered that he
      had travelled considerably and was familiar with many of the places to
      which, at different times, she had accompanied her father and mother, and
      over the interchange of recollections the little hint of discord&mdash;of
      challenge, almost&mdash;was forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were still chatting amicably together half an hour later when Blaise
      returned. The latter&rsquo;s face darkened as he entered the hall and
      found them together, nor did it lighten when Jean recounted the afternoon&rsquo;s
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Miss Peterson has your lodge-keeper&rsquo;s boys to thank
      for this?&rdquo; he demanded stormily of Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; admitted the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had any consideration for your neighbours, you&rsquo;d sack
      the lot of them,&rdquo; returned Blaise sharply. &ldquo;Or else see that
      they&rsquo;re kept under proper control. They&rsquo;ve given trouble
      before, but it is a little too much of a good thing when they dare to play
      practical jokes of that description on a guest of ours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at him in astonishment. She had told the story as rather a
      good joke and in explanation of Burke&rsquo;s presence, and, instead of
      laughing at her dilemma, Tormarin appeared to be thoroughly angry over the
      matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke remained coolly unprovoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve any quarrel with the young ruffians,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;They afforded me a charming afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; retorted Blaise. &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s hardly
      the point. Anyway&rdquo;&mdash;heatedly&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thank you
      to see that those lads are kept in hand for the future.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean glanced across at Burke with some apprehension, half fearing a
      responsive explosion of wrath on his part, but to her relief he was
      smiling&mdash;a twinkling, mirthful smile that redeemed the ugliness of
      his features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid I can&rsquo;t truthfully declare I&rsquo;m sorry,
      Tormarin,&rdquo; he said good-humouredly. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t, in my
      place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was keeping his temper in the face of considerable provocation,
      and Jean liked him better at that moment than she had done throughout the
      entire afternoon. Tormarin&rsquo;s own attitude she quite failed to
      understand, and after Burke&rsquo;s departure she took him to task for his
      churlishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was really absurd of you, Blaise,&rdquo; she scolded,
      half-smiling, half in genuine vexation. &ldquo;As if Mr. Burke could
      possibly be held responsible for the actions of a mischievous schoolboy!
      At least he did all he could to repair the damage; he brought me back, and
      recovered the missing pair of oars for me. You hadn&rsquo;t the least
      reason to flare up like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise listened to her quietly. The anger had died out of his face and his
      eyes were somewhat sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;absolutely
      right. But there rarely is any reason for a Tormarin&rsquo;s temper. Do
      you know&mdash;it sounds ridiculous, but it&rsquo;s perfectly true&mdash;it
      was all I could do not to knock Burke down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Blaise, you fill me with alarm! I&rsquo;d no idea you were
      such a bloodthirsty individual! But seriously, what had the poor man done
      to incur your wrath? He&rsquo;s been most helpful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an element of self-mockery in the brief smile which crossed his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that was just it. I&rsquo;ve rather grown to look upon it
      as my own particular prerogative to help you out of difficulties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, naturally I&rsquo;d rather it had been you,&rdquo; she
      allowed, twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that?&rdquo;&mdash;swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do&rdquo;&mdash;lightly. She had failed to notice the
      eagerness of demand in his quick question. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m more used to
      it! Besides, I believe Mr. Burke rather frightens me. He&rsquo;s a trifle&mdash;overwhelming.
      Still&rdquo;&mdash;shaking her head reprovingly&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think that excuses you. You must have a shocking temper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of the Tormarins have ruined their lives by their temper. I&rsquo;m
      no exception to the rule.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s thought flew back to the description she had overheard when
      in London: &ldquo;<i>A Tormarin in a temper is like a devil with the bit
      between his teeth</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s true, escaped her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s true?&rdquo;&mdash;with some surprise. &ldquo;That the
      Tormarins are a vile-tempered lot? Quite. If you want to know more about
      it, ask my mother. She&rsquo;ll tell you how I came by this white lock of
      hair&mdash;the mark of the beast.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was trying to make the comments of the woman at the hotel and Blaise&rsquo;s
      own confession tally with her recollection of the latter&rsquo;s complete
      self-control on several occasions when he, or any other man, might have
      been pardoned for yielding to momentary anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re exaggerating absurdly,&rdquo; she said at
      last. &ldquo;As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;ve often been surprised at your
      self-control, seeing that I know you have a temper concealed about you
      somewhere. I think that is why your anger this afternoon took me so aback.
      It seemed unlike you to be so fearfully annoyed over practically nothing
      at all. I don&rsquo;t believe&rdquo;&mdash;half smiling&mdash;&ldquo;that
      really you&rsquo;re anything like bad-tempered as a Tormarin ought to be&mdash;to
      support the family tradition!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking, not at her but beyond her, as she spoke, as though his
      thoughts dwelt with some past memory. His expression was inscrutable; she
      could not interpret it. Presently he turned back to her, and though he
      smiled there was a deep, unfathomable sadness in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had one unforgettable lesson,&rdquo; he said quietly.
      &ldquo;The Tormarin temper&mdash;the cursed inheritance of every one of us&mdash;has
      ruined my life just as it has ruined others before me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to fall on Jean&rsquo;s ears with a numbing sense of
      calamity, not alone in that past to which they primarily had reference,
      but as though thrusting forward in some mysterious way into the future&mdash;<i>her</i>
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a vague foreboding that that &ldquo;cursed
      inheritance&rdquo; of the Tormarins was destined, sooner or later, to
      impinge upon her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night, when she went to bed, her mind was still groping blindly in the
      dark places of dim premonition. Single sentences from the afternoon&rsquo;s
      conversation kept flitting through her brain, and when at last she slept
      it was to dream that she had lost her way and was wandering alone in a
      wild and desolate region. Presently she came to a solitary dwelling, set
      lonely in the midst of the interminable plain. Three wretched-looking
      scrubby little fir trees grew to one side of the house, all three of them
      bent in the same direction as though beaten and bowed forward by ceaseless
      winds. While she stood wondering whether she should venture to knock at
      the door of the house and ask her way, it opened and Geoffrey Burke came
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! There you are!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as though he had been
      expecting her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waiting for you. Will you come into
      my parlour?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her as he spoke&mdash;she could see the even flash of his
      white teeth&mdash;but there was something in the quality of the smile
      which terrified her, and without answering a word she turned to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he overtook her in a couple of strides, catching her by the hand in a
      grip so fierce that it seemed as though the bones of her fingers must
      crack under it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into my parlour,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,
      you&rsquo;ll be stamped forever with the mark of the beast. It&rsquo;s too
      late to try and run away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean woke in a cold perspiration of terror. The dream had been of such
      vividness that it was a full minute before she could realise that,
      actually, she was safely tucked up in her own bed at Staple. When she did,
      the relief was so immeasurable that she almost cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, with the May sunshine streaming in through the open
      window, it was easier to laugh at her nocturnal fears, and to trace the
      odd phrases which, snatched from the previous day&rsquo;s conversation
      with Burke and Tormarin and jumbled up together, had supplied the
      nightmare horror of her dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, even so, it was many days before she could altogether shake off the
      disagreeable impression it had made on her.

      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;A COMPACT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;Y</span> OU don&rsquo;t
      like Jean Peterson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke made the announcement without preface. He and Judith were sitting
      together on the verandah at Willow Perry, where their coffee had been
      brought them after lunch. Judith inhaled a whiff of cigarette smoke before
      she answered. Then, without any change of expression, her eyes fixed on
      the glowing tip of her cigarette, she answered composedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Did you expect I should?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hang it all, you don&rsquo;t hold her accountable for her
      father&rsquo;s defection, do you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull red crept up under Mrs. Craig&rsquo;s sallow skin, but she did not
      lift her eyes. They were still intent on the little red star of light
      dulling slowly into grey ash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not accountable,&rdquo; she replied coolly. &ldquo;I look upon her
      as an unpleasant consequence.&rdquo; She bent forward suddenly. &ldquo;Do
      you realise that she might have been&mdash;my child?&rdquo; There was a
      sudden vibrating quality in her voice, and for an instant a rapt look
      came into her face, transforming its hard lines. &ldquo;But she isn&rsquo;t.
      She happens to be the child of the man I loved&mdash;and another woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You surely can&rsquo;t hate her for that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I? You don&rsquo;t know much about women, Geoff. Glyn
      Peterson stamped on my pride, and a woman never forgives that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in her chair again, her face once more an indifferent
      mask. Burke sat silent, staring broodingly in front of him. Presently her
      glance flickered curiously over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does it matter to you whether I like her or not?&rdquo; she
      asked, breaking the silence which had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke shifted in his chair so that he faced her. His eyes looked far more
      red than brown at the moment, as though they glowed with some hot inner
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said deliberately, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to
      marry her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith sat suddenly upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the meaning of your constant pilgrimages to Staple,
      is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed&mdash;a disagreeable little laugh like a douche of cold water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather late in the field, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that Blaise Tormarin wants her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do. It&rsquo;s evident enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke pulled at his pipe reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have thought he&rsquo;d had a sickener with Nesta Freyne.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he had. But not in the way you mean. He never&mdash;loved&mdash;Nesta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why on earth did he ask her to marry him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens, Geoffrey! You&rsquo;re a man&mdash;and you ask me
      that! There are heaps of men who ask women to marry them on the strength
      of a temporary infatuation, and then regret it ever after. Luckily for
      Blaise, Nesta saved him the &lsquo;ever after&rsquo; part. But&rdquo;&mdash;eyeing
      him significantly&mdash;&ldquo;Blaise&rsquo;s feeling for Jean isn&rsquo;t
      of the &lsquo;temporary&rsquo; type. Of that I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, I don&rsquo;t believe he means to ask her to marry
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think he does&mdash;<i>mean</i> to. He&rsquo;s
      probably got some high-minded scruples about not asking a second woman to
      make a mess of her life as a result of the Tormarin temper. It would be
      just like Blaise to adopt that attitude. But he <i>will</i> ask her, all
      the same. The thing&rsquo;ll get too strong for him. And when he asks her,
      Jean will say yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right. I&rsquo;ve always said you were no fool, Judy.
      But if it&rsquo;s as you think, then I must get in first, that&rsquo;s
      all. First or last, though&rdquo;&mdash;with a grim laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      back myself to beat Blaise Tormarin. <i>And you&rsquo;ve got to help me.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed a silence while Judith threw away the stump of her cigarette and
      lit another. She did not hurry over the process, but went about it slowly
      and deliberately, holding the flame of the match to the tip of her
      cigarette for quite an unnecessarily long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind if I do,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think I&mdash;envy&mdash;your wife much, Geoffrey. She won&rsquo;t be a
      very happy woman, so I don&rsquo;t mind assisting Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s
      daughter to the position. It would make things so charming all round if he
      and I ever met again&rdquo;&mdash;smiling ironically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke looked at her with a mixture of admiration and disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a thorough-going little beast you are, Judith,&rdquo; he
      observed tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrugged her thin, supple shoulders with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make myself. Glyn Peterson had a good share in
      kneading the dough; why shouldn&rsquo;t his daughter eat the bread? And
      anyhow, old thing&rdquo;&mdash;her whole face suddenly softening&mdash;&ldquo;I
      should like you to have what you want&mdash;even if you wanted the moon!
      So you can count on me. But I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll find it all
      plain sailing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;sardonically. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll likely be a
      little devil to break.... Well, start being a bit more friendly, will you?
      Ask her to lunch.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, a day or two later, a charming little note found its way to
      Staple, inviting Jean to lunch with Mrs. Craig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be quite alone,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;as Geoffrey is going
      off for a day&rsquo;s fishing, so I hope Lady Anne will spare you to come
      over and keep me company for an hour or two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was delighted at this evidence that Judith was thawing towards her.
      She was genuinely anxious that they should become friends, feeling that it
      was up to her, as Glyn&rsquo;s daughter, to atone&mdash;in so far as
      friendliness and sympathy could be said to atone&mdash;for his treatment
      of her. Beyond this, she had a vague hope that later, if she and Judith
      ever became intimate enough to touch on the happenings of the past, she
      might be able to make the latter see her father in the same light in which
      she herself saw him&mdash;as a charming, lovable, irresponsible child,
      innocent of any intention to wound, but with all a child&rsquo;s
      unregarding pursuit of a desired object, irrespective of the consequences
      to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that if only Judith could better comprehend Glyn&rsquo;s nature,
      she would not only be disposed to judge him less hardly, but, to a certain
      extent, would find healing for her own bitterness of resentment and hurt
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith was an unhappy woman, embittered by one of those blows in life
      which a woman finds hardest to hear. And Jean hated people to be unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that it was with considerable satisfaction that she set out across the
      park towards Willow Perry, crossing the river by the footbridge which
      spanned it at a point about a quarter of a mile below the scene of her
      boating mishap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith welcomed her with unaccustomed warmth, and after lunch completely
      won her heart by a candour seemingly akin to Jean&rsquo;s own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been quite hateful to you since you came to Staple,&rdquo;
      she said frankly. &ldquo;Just because you were&mdash;who you were. I
      suppose&rdquo;&mdash;turning her head a little aside&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
      heard&mdash;you know that old story?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Jean murmured an affirmative, she went on quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was idiotic of me to feel unfriendly to you because you
      happened to be Glyn&rsquo;s daughter, and I&rsquo;m honestly ashamed of
      myself. I should have loved you at once&mdash;you&rsquo;re rather a dear,
      you know!&mdash;if you had been anyone else. So will you let me love you
      now, please&mdash;if it isn&rsquo;t too late?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was charmingly done, and Jean received the friendly overture with all
      the enthusiasm dictated by a generous and spontaneous nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; she agreed gladly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s begin
      over again&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith smiled back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll make a fresh start.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that, things progressed swimmingly. The slight gene which had
      attended the earlier stages of the visit vanished, and very soon, prompted
      by Judith&rsquo;s eager, interested questions, Jean found herself chatting
      away quite naturally and happily about her life before she came to Staple
      and confessing how much she was enjoying her first experience of England.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so soft, and pretty, and old,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I feel as if Staple must always have been here&mdash;just where it
      is, looking across to the Moor, and nodding sometimes, as much as to say,
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been here so long that I know some of your secrets.&rsquo;
      The Moor always seems to me to have secrets,&rdquo; she added dreamily.
      &ldquo;Those great tors watch us all the time, just as they&rsquo;ve
      watched for centuries. They remind me of the Egyptian Sphinx, they are so
      still, and silent, and&mdash;and eternal-looking.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve not been on to Dartmoor yet, have you?&rdquo; asked
      Judith. &ldquo;We have a bungalow up there&mdash;Three Fir Bungalow, it&rsquo;s
      called. You must come and spend a few days there with us when the weather
      gets warmer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should love it,&rdquo; cried Jean, her eyes sparkling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      aching to go to the Moor. I want to see it in all sorts of moods&mdash;when
      it&rsquo;s raining, and when the sun&rsquo;s shining, and when the wind
      blows. I&rsquo;m sure it will be different each time&mdash;rather like a
      woman.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s loveliest of all by moonlight,&rdquo; said
      Judith, her eyes soft and shining with recollection. She loved all the
      beauty of the world as much as Jean herself did. &ldquo;I remember being
      on the top of one of the tors at night. All the surrounding valleys were
      hidden in a mist like a silver sea, and I felt as if I had got right away
      from the everyday world, into a sort of holy of holies that God must have
      made for His spirits. One almost forgot that one was just an ordinary,
      plain-boiled human being tied up in a parcel of flesh and bone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only people aren&rsquo;t really in the least plain-boiled or
      ordinary,&rdquo; observed Jean quaintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t, I verily believe.&rdquo; Judith regarded her
      curiously for a moment. &ldquo;I think I wish you were,&rdquo; she said
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not finding the part assigned to her by her brother any too easy.
      It complicates matters, when you are deliberately planning a semblance of
      friendship towards someone, if that someone persists in inspiring you with
      little genuine impulses of liking and friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean herself was delighted with the result of her visit to Willow Perry.
      She was convinced that Judith was a much nicer woman than she had
      imagined, or than anyone else imagined her to be, and when she took her
      departure she carried these warmer sentiments with her, characteristically
      reproaching herself not a little for her first hasty judgment. People
      improved upon acquaintance enormously, she reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not go straight back to Staple, but took her way towards Charnwood
      on the chance of finding Claire at home, and, Fate being in a benevolent
      mood, she discovered her in her garden, precariously mounted upon a ladder
      and occupied in nailing back a creeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire greeted her joyfully and proceeded to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been lunching at Willow Perry,&rdquo; explained Jean,
      &ldquo;so I thought I might as well come on here and cadge my tea as well!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you might Adrian has gone into Exeter to-day, so we shall
      be alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was conscious of an immense relief. The knowledge that Sir Adrian was
      not anywhere on the premises seemed like the lifting of a blight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s blue eyes smiled at her understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she nodded, as though Jean had given voice to
      her thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as if someone had opened a window and
      let the fresh air in, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She collected her tools, and slipping her arm within Jean&rsquo;s led her
      in the direction of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have tea at once,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and then I&rsquo;ll
      walk back with you part way.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bent on getting rid of me quickly, then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;seriously. &ldquo;He&rdquo;&mdash;there was little
      need to specify to whom the pronoun referred&mdash;&ldquo;will be back by
      the afternoon train, and for some reason or other he is very unfriendly
      towards you just now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have I done to offend?&rdquo; queried Jean lightly. Somehow,
      with Sir Adrian actually away, it didn&rsquo;t seem a matter of much
      importance whether he was offended or not. Even the house had a different
      &ldquo;feel&rdquo; about it as they entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not anything you&rsquo;ve done; it&rsquo;s what you are,
      I think, sometimes, that when a man is full of evil and cruel thoughts and
      knows he has given himself up to wickedness, he simply hates to see anyone
      young and&mdash;and <i>good</i>, like you are, Jean, with all your life
      before you to make a splendid thing of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about you?&rdquo; asked Jean, her eyes resting
      affectionately on the other&rsquo;s delicate flower face with its
      pathetically curved lips and the look of trouble in the young blue eyes.
      &ldquo;He sees you constantly.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s used to me. I&rsquo;m only his wife, you see.
      Besides&rdquo;&mdash;wearily&mdash;&ldquo;he knows that he can effectually
      prevent me from making a splendid thing of my life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The note of bitterness in her voice wrung Jean&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you bear it!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One can bear anything&mdash;a day at a time,&rdquo; answered Claire
      with an attempt at brightness. &ldquo;But I never look forward,&rdquo; she
      added in a lower tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words seemed to Jean to contain an epitome of tragedy. Not yet twenty,
      and Claire&rsquo;s whole philosophy of life was embodied in those four
      desolate words: &ldquo;I never look forward!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The world seemed built up of sadness and cross-purposes. Claire and Nick,
      Judith, and Blaise Tormarin&mdash;all had their own particular burdens to
      carry, burdens which had in a measure spoiled the lives of each one of
      them. It seemed as though no one was allowed to escape those &ldquo;snuffers
      of Destiny&rdquo; of which Blaise had spoken as he and Jean had climbed
      the mountain-side together. She felt a depressing conviction that her own
      turn would come and wondered whether it would be sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so blue!&rdquo; Claire&rsquo;s voice broke in upon
      her gloomy trend of thought. She was laughing, and Jean was conscious of a
      sudden uprush of admiration for the young gay courage which could laugh
      even while it could not look forward. &ldquo;After all, there are
      compensations in life. You&rsquo;re one of them, my Jean, as I&rsquo;ve
      told you before! Now let&rsquo;s talk about something else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean responded gladly enough, and presently Sir Adrian was temporarily
      forgotten in the little intimate half-hour of woman-talk which followed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV&mdash;LADY ANNE&rsquo;S DISCLOSURE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;W</span> ELL, have
      you enjoyed yourself?&rdquo; enquired Lady Anne when Jean returned.
      &ldquo;I suppose so, as you stayed to tea&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had tea with Claire. Sir Adrian was away&rdquo;&mdash;with a
      small grimace&mdash;&ldquo;so we had quite a nice little time together.
      But, yes, madonna&rdquo;&mdash;Jean had fallen into the use of the
      gracious little name which Blaise and Nick kept for their mother&mdash;&ldquo;I
      really enjoyed myself very much. Judith was ever so much nicer than I
      expected.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now, I suppose, we shall all be side-tracked in favour of Burke
      and his sister?&rdquo; put in Blaise, who had been listening quietly.
      There was a sharpness in his tones, as though the prospect did not please.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled at him engagingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you will,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I invariably
      sidetrack old friends when I get the chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get the chance right enough!&rdquo;&mdash;rather
      sulkily. &ldquo;Yes, I think I shall&rdquo;&mdash;demurely. &ldquo;Geoffrey
      has always been nice to me; and now Judith, too, has succumbed to my
      charms, and says she hopes we shall be good pals.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin rose, pushing back his chair with unnecessary violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I see Judith Craig extending her friendship to
      Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; he commented cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant later the door banged behind, and Lady Anne and Jean looked
      across at each other smiling, as women will when one of their menkind
      proceeds to behave exactly like a cross little boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a quick sigh chased the smile from Lady Anne&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Blaise!&rdquo; she murmured, as though to herself. Then,
      her grey eyes meeting Jean&rsquo;s squarely, she said quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean, you&rsquo;re so much one of us, now, that I should like you
      to know what lies at the hack of things. You&rsquo;d understand&mdash;some
      of us&mdash;better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean turned impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to understand you,&rdquo; she said quickly.
      &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my dear.&rdquo; Lady Anne&rsquo;s voice trembled
      slightly. &ldquo;If I were not sure of that, I shouldn&rsquo;t tell you
      what I am going to. But I want you to understand Blaise&mdash;and to make
      allowances for him, if you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean pulled forward a stool and settled herself at Lady Anno&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean about the &lsquo;mark of the beast&rsquo;?&rdquo; she
      asked, smiling a little. &ldquo;Blaise told me to ask you about it one
      day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he? He thinks far too much about it and what it stands for&rdquo;&mdash;sadly.
      &ldquo;It has come to be almost a symbol in his eyes. You see, he too has
      suffered from the family failing&mdash;the very failing that was
      responsible for that white lock of hair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne looked down at her thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no need for me to tell you that the Tor-marins
      have hot tempers! You&rsquo;ve seen evidences of it in Blaise&mdash;that
      sudden flaming up of anger. Though he has learnt through one most bitter
      experience to hold himself more or less in check.&rdquo; She paused a
      moment, as if her thoughts had reverted painfully to the past. Presently
      she resumed: &ldquo;All the Tormarin men have had it&mdash;that blazing,
      uncontrollable kind of temper which simply cannot brook opposition. Blaise&rsquo;s
      father had it, and it was that which made our life together so unhappy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Destiny had been busy with her snuffers here, also!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you, too!&rdquo; whispered Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I. too?&rdquo; Lady Anne questioned. &ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it seems to me as if <i>no one</i> is ever allowed to be
      really happy and to live their life in peace! There is Judith, whose life
      my father spoilt, and Claire, whose life Sir Adrian spoils&mdash;and that
      means Nick&rsquo;s life as well. And now&mdash;you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Some unconscious instinct of reticence deep within her forbade the mention
      of Blaise Tormarin&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect we are not meant to be too joyful,&rdquo; said Lady Anne.
      &ldquo;Though, after all, it&rsquo;s largely our own fault if we are not.
      We make or mar each other&rsquo;s happiness; it isn&rsquo;t all Fate....
      But I&rsquo;ve had my share of happiness, Jean&mdash;never think that I
      haven&rsquo;t. Afterwards, with Claude, I was utterly happy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell silent for a space, ceasing on that quiet note of happiness.
      Presently, almost loth to disturb the reverie into which she had fallen,
      Jean questioned hesitantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the &lsquo;mark of the beast,&rsquo; madonna? You were going to
      tell me about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It came as a consequence of the Tormarin temper. That&rsquo;s why
      Blaise calls it the &lsquo;mark of the beast.&rsquo; It was just before he
      was born&mdash;when I was waiting for the supreme joy of holding my
      first-born in my arms. Derrick&mdash;Blaise&rsquo;s father&mdash;was an
      extremely jealous-natured man. He hated to think that there had ever been
      anyone besides himself who cared for me. And there was one man, in
      particular, of whom he had always been foolishly jealous and suspicious. I
      can&rsquo;t imagine why, though&rdquo;&mdash;with a little puzzled laugh.
      &ldquo;You would think that the mere fact that I had married <i>him</i>,
      and not the other man, would have been sufficient proof that he had no
      cause for jealousy. But no! Men are queer creatures, and he always
      resented my friendship with John Lovett&mdash;which continued after my
      marriage. I had known John from childhood, and he was the truest friend a
      woman ever had!&rdquo; She sighed: &ldquo;And I needed friends in those
      days! For somehow, brooding over things to himself, my husband conceived
      the idea that the little son who was coming was not his own child&mdash;but
      the child of John Lovett. I think someone must have poisoned his mind.
      There was a certain woman of our acquaintance whom I always suspected; she
      hated me and was very much attached to Derrick&mdash;she had wanted to
      marry him, I believe. In any case, he came home one evening, from her
      house, like a madman; and there was a scene... a terrible scene... he
      hurling accusations at me.... I won&rsquo;t talk of it, because he was
      bitterly repentant afterwards. As soon as the fit of rage was past, he
      realised how utterly groundless his suspicions had been, and I don&rsquo;t
      think he ever ceased to reproach himself. But that has always been the
      way! The Tormarins have invariably brought the bitterest self-reproach
      upon themselves. One way or another, the same story of blind, reckless
      anger, and its consequences, has repeated itself generation after
      generation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then? What happened then?&rdquo; asked Jean in low, shocked
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was very ill&mdash;so ill that they thought I should not live.
      But I did live, and I brought my baby into the world. Only, he was born
      with that white lock of hair. And my own hair had turned perfectly white.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent for a little. At last she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad, madonna, that you were happy afterwards. <i>Your</i>
      &lsquo;house of dreams&rsquo; came true in the end!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Anne&rsquo;s grey eyes were very bright and
      luminous. &ldquo;My house of dreams came true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while, she went on quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my poor Blaise&rsquo;s house of dreams fell in ruins. The
      foundation was rotten. You knew, didn&rsquo;t you, that there was a woman
      he once cared for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded. Speech was difficult to her just at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a miserable business altogether. The girl, Nesta Freyne was
      an Italian. Blaise met her when he was travelling in Italy, and&mdash;oh,
      well, it wasn&rsquo;t love! Not love as I know it, and as I think, one
      day, you too will know it. It blazed up, just one of those wild
      infatuations that sometimes spring into being between a man and a woman,
      and almost before he had time to think, Blaise had married her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Married her!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words leapt from Jean&rsquo;s lips before she could check them. In the
      account of Tormarin&rsquo;s disastrous love affair which had been forced
      upon her hearing in London, there had been no mention of the word
      marriage, and she had always imagined that the woman, this Nesta Freyne,
      had simply jilted him in favour of another man. Moreover, since she had
      been at Staple, nothing had been said to correct this impression, as, very
      naturally, the subject was one avoided by general consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, without warning or preparation, she found herself face to face
      with the fact that Blaise had been married&mdash;that he had belonged to
      another woman! It seemed to set her suddenly very far apart from him, and
      a fierce, intolerable jealousy of that other woman leaped to life in her
      heart, racking her with an anguish that was almost physical. She was
      confused, bewildered, by the storm of emotion which suddenly swept her
      whole being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Married her?&rdquo; she repeated with dry lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Didn&rsquo;t you know that Blaise was a widower?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Lady Anne divined the stress under which the girl was labouring that
      she so quickly interposed the knowledge that his wife was dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Jean unsteadily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even
      know that he had been married.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact of that other woman&rsquo;s being dead did not serve to allay the
      tumult within her. She had lived, and while she lived she had been <i>his
      wife!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he married her.&rdquo; Lady Anne went on speaking in level
      tones. &ldquo;I think matters were hurried to a climax by the fact that
      Nesta&rsquo;s step-sister, Margherita Valdi, detested English people. She
      was much the elder of the two, and as their mother had died when Nesta was
      born, she had practically brought the girl up. She would never have
      countenanced the idea of her marrying an Englishman, but Nesta so
      contrived her meetings with Blaise that Margherita was unaware of his very
      existence, and eventually they married without her knowledge. From that
      day onward, Margherita declined to hold any communication with her sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why had she such a rooted antipathy to the English?&rdquo; Jean had
      recovered her composure during the course of Lady Anne&rsquo;s narrative,
      and now put her question with a very good semblance of detachment. But,
      inside, her brain was dully hammering out the words &ldquo;Married&mdash;married!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that Margherita&rsquo;s step-father&mdash;Nesta&rsquo;s
      father, of course,&mdash;who was an Englishman, treated his wife extremely
      badly, and Margherita, who had adored her mother, never forgave him and
      hated all Englishmen in consequence. At least, that was what Nesta told
      Blaise, and it seems quite probable. Italians are a hot-blooded race, you
      know, and very vindictive and revengeful. Of course, these Valdis were of
      no particular family&mdash;that was where the trouble began. Nesta was
      just a rather second-rate, though extraordinarily beautiful girl, suddenly
      elevated to a position which she was not in the least fitted to fill. It
      didn&rsquo;t take a month for the glamour to wear off&mdash;and for Blaise
      to see her as I saw her. He came to his senses to find himself married to
      a bit of soulless, passionate flesh and blood. Oh, Jean! If I could only
      have been there&mdash;in Italy, to have saved him from it all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean hardly heeded that instinctive mother-cry. She was keyed up to know
      the end of the story. She felt as though she must scream if Lady Anne were
      long about the telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said, forcing herself to speak quietly. &ldquo;Tell
      me the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest had the Tormarin temper for its corner-stone. Nesta was an
      utterly spoilt child, and a coquette to her very finger-tips. She tossed
      dignity to the winds, and there were everlasting scenes and quarrels.
      Then, one day, Blaise came in and found her entertaining a man whom he had
      forbidden the house. I don&rsquo;t know what he said to her&mdash;but I
      can guess, poor child! He horsewhipped the man, and he must have
      frightened Nesta half out of her mind. That evening she ran away from
      Staple&mdash;Nick and I, of course, were living at the Dower House then&mdash;and
      after months of fruitless enquiry I had a letter from Margherita Valdi
      telling me that she had been found drowned. She had evidently made her way
      back to Italy, hoping to reach her sister, and then, in a fit of despair,
      committed suicide.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor Blaise! How awful for him!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean,
      horror-stricken. For the moment her own individual point of view was swept
      away in a flood of sympathy for Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It broke him up badly. Always, I think, he is brooding over
      the past. It colours his entire outlook on things. You see, he blamed
      himself&mdash;his ungovernable temper&mdash;for the whole tragedy.... If
      only he had been gentler with her, not terrified her into running away!...
      After all, she was a mere child&mdash;barely seventeen. But she was a
      heartless, conscienceless minx, nevertheless.... And Margherita Valdi did
      not let him down lightly. She wrote him a terrible letter, accusing him of
      her sister&rsquo;s death. I opened it&mdash;he was abroad at the time&mdash;but,
      of course, he had to see it ultimately. Tied up in a little separate
      packet was Nesta&rsquo;s wedding-ring, together with a newspaper report of
      the affair, and, to add a last stab of horror, she had folded the
      newspaper clipping and thrust it through the wedding-ring, labelling the
      packet &lsquo;Cause and effect.&rsquo; It was a brutal thing to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent for a space, Jean painfully envisaging the tragedy
      that lay behind that stern, habitual gravity of Tormarin&rsquo;s, Lady
      Anne asking herself tremulously if she had been wise&mdash;if she had been
      wise in her disclosure? She wanted her son&rsquo;s happiness so
      immeasurably! She believed she knew wherein it might lie, and she had
      raked over the burning embers of the past that she might help to give it
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he himself was very unlikely to confide in Jean the story of
      his unhappy marriage, or that if he ever did so, it would be but to
      shoulder all the blame himself, exonerating Nesta entirely. Nor, unless
      Jean understood the fiery furnace through which he had passed&mdash;that
      ordeal of impetuous, mistaken love, of disillusion, and, finally, of the
      most bitter self-reproach&mdash;could she possibly interpret aright Blaise&rsquo;s
      strange, churlish moods, his insistent efforts to stand always on one
      side, as though he were entitled to make no further claim on life, and,
      above all, the bitter quality which permeated his whole outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things had been in Lady Anne&rsquo;s mind when she had decided
      to enlighten Jean. She had seen, just as Judith had seen, whither Blaise
      was tending, fight against it as he might, and she was determined to
      remove from his path whatever of stumbling-block and hindrance she could.
      And, in this instance, she felt instinctively that Jean&rsquo;s own
      attitude might constitute the greatest danger. Any woman, as sincere and
      positive as she, might easily be driven in upon herself, shrinkingly
      misunderstanding Blaise&rsquo;s deliberate aloofness, and thus
      unconsciously assist in strengthening that barrier against love which he
      was striving to hold in place between them&mdash;and which Lady Anne so
      yearned to see thrown down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to this end that she had reopened the shadowed pages of the past&mdash;so
      that no foolish obstacle, born of sheer misunderstanding, might imperil
      her son&rsquo;s hope of happiness if the time should ever come&mdash;as
      she prayed it would come&mdash;when he would free himself from the
      shackles of a tragic memory and turn his face towards the light of a new
      dawn.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE GIFT OF LOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE are some
      people to whom love comes in a single blinding flash; it is as though the
      heavens were opened and the vision and the glory theirs in a sudden,
      transcendant revelation. To others it comes gradually, their hearts
      opening diffidently to its warmth and light as a closed bud unfolds its
      petals, almost imperceptibly, to the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Jean, its coming partook in a measure of both of these. Love itself
      did not come to her suddenly. It had been secretly growing and deepening
      within her for months. But the recognition of it came upon her with an
      overwhelming suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne, in recalling that bleak tragedy of the past, had accomplished
      more than she knew. She had shown Jean her own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      From those fierce, unexpected pangs of jealousy which had stabbed her as
      she realised the part played by another woman in Blaise&rsquo;s life&mdash;the
      woman who had been his wife&mdash;had sprung the knowledge that she loved
      him. Only love could explain the instant, clamorous rebellion of her whole
      being against that other woman&rsquo;s claim. And now, looking back upon
      the months which she had spent at Staple, she comprehended that the veiled
      figure of Love, face shrouded, had walked beside her all the way. That was
      why these even, uneventful weeks at Staple had seemed so wonderful!
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognition of the great thing that had come into her life left her a
      little breathless and shaken. But she did not seek to evade or deny it.
      The absolute candour of her mind&mdash;candid even to itself&mdash;accepted
      the truth quite simply and frankly. No false shame that she had, as far as
      actual fact went, given her love unasked, tempted her to disguise from
      herself the reality of what had happened. For good or ill, whether Blaise
      returned her love or no, it was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in her inmost heart she believed that he, too, cared&mdash;half-fearfully,
      half-joyfully recognising the pent-up force which surged behind the bars
      of his deliberate aloofness.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he had never definitely spoken of his love in so many words, hut
      Lady Anne had supplied the key to his silence. The past still bound him!
      Alive, Nesta had held him by her beauty; and dead, she still held him with
      the cords of remorse and unavailing self-reproach&mdash;cords which can
      bind almost as closely as the strands of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for that&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hot colour surged into Jean&rsquo;s cheeks at the sweet, secret
      thought which lay behind that &ldquo;but&rdquo;. Blaise cared! Cared for
      her, needed her, just as she cared for and needed him. To her woman&rsquo;s
      eyes, newly anointed with love&rsquo;s sacramental oil and given sight, it
      had become suddenly evident in a hundred ways, most of all evident in his
      sullen effort to conceal it from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So much that he had said, or had not said&mdash;those clipped sentences,
      bitten off short with a savage intensity that had often enough troubled
      and bewildered her, now found their right interpretation. He cared... but
      the bondage of the past still held.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that thought came reaction. The brief, quivering ecstacy, which
      had sent little fugitive thrills and currents racing through every nerve
      of her, died suddenly like a damped-out fire, as she realised all which
      that bondage implied.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible he might never break the silence which he himself had
      decreed. From the very beginning he had recognised and insisted upon&mdash;the
      fact that they two were only &ldquo;ships that pass,&rdquo; and though
      now, for a little space, Fate had directed the course of each into the
      same channel, a year, at most, would float them out again on to the big
      ocean of life where vessels signalled&mdash;and passed&mdash;each other.
      She must, in the ordinary course of events, return eventually to
      Beirnfels, while Blaise remained in England. And that would be the end of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew the man&rsquo;s dogged pertinacity; he would hold to an idea or
      belief immovably if he conceived it right, no matter what the temptation
      to break away. And in the flood of light vouchsafed by Lady Anne&rsquo;s
      disclosure, she felt convinced that he had somehow come to regard the
      tragic happenings of the past as standing betwixt him and any future
      happiness. Why, Jean could not altogether fathom, but she guessed that the
      dominant factor in the matter was probably an exaggerated consciousness of
      responsibility for his wife&rsquo;s death, and perhaps, too, a certain
      lingering tenderness, a subconscious feeling of loyalty to the dead woman,
      which urged him on to the sacrifice of his own personal happiness as some
      kind of atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless&mdash;and a swift spasm of pain shot through her, searing its way
      like a tongue of flame&mdash;unless Lady Anne had been altogether mistaken
      in her fixed belief that Blaise had not really cared for his wife but had
      only been carried away on the swift tide of passion&mdash;that tide which
      runs so fiercely and untrammelled in hot youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had her black hour then, when she faced the fact that although her
      love was given, and although she tremulously believed it was returned, she
      would probably never know the supreme joy of utter certainty, never hear
      the beloved&rsquo;s voice utter those words which hold all heaven for the
      woman who hears them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, through the darkness that closed about her, there gleamed a single
      thread of light&mdash;the light of her own bestowal of love. Even if she
      never knew, of a surety, that Blaise cared, even if&mdash;and here she
      shrank, but forced herself to face the possibility sincerely&mdash;even if
      she were utterly mistaken and he did not care for her in any other way
      save as a friend&mdash;his &ldquo;little comrade&rdquo;&mdash;still there
      would remain always the golden gleam of love that has been given. For no
      one who loves can be quite unhappy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII&mdash;IN THE ROSE GARDEN
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE chalcedony of
      the spring skies had deepened into the glowing sapphire of early June&mdash;a
      deep, pulsating blue, tremulous with heat. On the sundial, the shadow&rsquo;s
      finger pointed to twelve o&rsquo;clock, and the sleepy hush of noontide
      hung over the rose garden where Jean was gathering roses for the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s voice broke across the drowsy quiet so unexpectedly that she
      jumped, almost letting fall the scissors with which she was scientifically
      snipping the stems of the roses. She bestowed a small frown upon the head
      and shoulders appearing above the wooden gate on which he leant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not very helpful to begin by giving one an electric
      shock,&rdquo; she complained. &ldquo;How long have you been there?&rdquo;
      His attitude had a repose about it which suggested that he might have been
      standing there some time watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But as I <i>am</i> here, may I come in?&rdquo;
      Without waiting for her answer, he unlatched the gate and came striding
      across the velvet greenness of the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His visits to Staple had grown of late so much a matter of daily
      occurrence that they were no longer hedged about by any ceremony, and Jean
      had come to accept his appearance at any odd moment without surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the day when she had lunched at Willow Eerry, and learned, as she
      believed, to understand and make allowances for the bitterness which had
      so warped Judith&rsquo;s nature, her acquaintance with both brother and
      sister had ripened rapidly into a friendly intimacy. But the fact that
      Burke&rsquo;s feeling towards her was something other, and much warmer
      than mere friendship, had failed to penetrate her consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was patent enough to the lookers on, and probably Jean was the only one
      amongst the little coterie of intimate friends who had not realised what
      was impending.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not very often that a woman remains entirely oblivious of the small,
      unmistakable signs which go to indicate a man&rsquo;s attitude towards
      her. In Jean&rsquo;s case, however, her thoughts were so engrossed with
      the one man that, at the moment, all other men occupied but a very shadowy
      relationship towards the realities of life as far as she was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that she scarcely troubled to look up as Burke halted beside her, but
      went on cutting her roses unconcernedly, merely observing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Idlers not allowed. You can make yourself useful by paring the
      thorns off the stems.&rdquo; She gestured towards a basket which stood on
      the ground at her side, already overflowing with its scented burden of
      pink and white and crimson roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the russet head bent studiously above a bush rose and there
      was a gleam, half angry, half amused, in his eyes. His fingers went
      uncertainly to his pocket, where reposed a serviceable knife, then
      suddenly he drew his hand sharply away, empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come over to be useful
      this morning. I came over&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke slowly, as though
      endeavouring to gain her attention&mdash;&ldquo;on a quite different
      errand.&rdquo; There was a vibration in his voice that might have warned
      her had she been less intent upon her task of wrestling with a refractory
      branch. As it was, she merely questioned absently:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what was the &lsquo;quite different&rsquo; errand?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment she felt his hand close over both hers, gardening scissors
      and wash-leather gloves notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop cutting those confounded flowers, and I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo;
      he said roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up in astonishment, and, at last, a glimmering of what was
      coming dawned upon her. Even the blindest of women, the most preoccupied,
      must have read the expression of his eyes at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;no,&rdquo; she began hastily. &ldquo;I must finish
      cutting the roses&mdash;really, Geoffrey.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried to release her hands, but he held them firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t finish cutting
      your flowers&mdash;at least, not now. You&rsquo;re going to listen to me.&rdquo;
      He drew the scissors from her grasp, and they flashed like a fish in the
      sunshine as he tossed them down on to the rose-basket. Then, quite
      deliberately, he pulled off the loose gloves she was wearing and his big
      hands gripped themselves suddenly, closely, about her slight, bared ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice wavered uncertainly. The realisation of his intent had come upon
      her so unexpectedly, rousing her from her placid unconsciousness, that she
      felt stunned&mdash;nervously unready to deal with the situation. She
      struggled a little, instinctively, but he only laughed down at her, a ring
      of masterful triumph in his voice, holding her effortlessly, with all the
      ease of his immense strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no good, Jean. You&rsquo;ve got to hear me out. I&rsquo;ve
      waited long enough.&rdquo; He paused, then drew a deep breath. &ldquo;I
      love you!&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;My God, how I love you!&rdquo;
      There was an element of wonder in his tones, and she felt the strong hands
      gripping hers tremble a little. Then their clasp tightened and he drew her
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say you love me,&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Say it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then Jean found her voice. The imperious demand, infringing on that
      secret, inner claim of which she alone knew, stung her into quick denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t! I don&rsquo;t love you!&rdquo; Then, as she saw
      the blank look in his eyes, she went on hastily: &ldquo;Oh, Geoffrey, I am
      so sorry. I never guessed&mdash;I never thought of your caring.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never guessed! Good God!&rdquo;&mdash;with a harsh laugh&mdash;&ldquo;I
      should have thought I&rsquo;d made it plain enough. Why, even that first
      day, on the river&mdash;I wanted you then. What do you suppose has brought
      me to Staple every day? Affection for Blaise Tormarin?&rdquo;&mdash;cynically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She cast about in
      her mind for an answer, then presented him with the simple truth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid I never thought about it at all. I just took your coming over for
      granted. I knew you and Judith were old friends and neighbours, so it
      seemed quite natural for you to be here often&mdash;just as Claire Latimer
      is.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke searched her face for a moment. He was thinking of the other women
      he had known&mdash;women who would never have remained blind to his
      meaning, who had, indeed, shown their willingness to come half-way&mdash;more
      than half-way&mdash;to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really believe that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he said at last,
      grudgingly. &ldquo;But if it is, you&rsquo;re the most unselfconscious
      woman I&rsquo;ve ever come across.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; she replied simply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      so sorry, Geoffrey. I like you far too much to have wished to hurt you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want liking. I want your love. And I mean to have it.
      You may not have understood before, Jean, but you do now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself away from him a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t make any difference, Geoffrey. I have no love to
      give you,&rdquo; she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take no,&rdquo; he said doggedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
      the woman I want. And I mean to have you.... Don&rsquo;t you understand?
      It&rsquo;s no use fighting against me. You may say no, now; you may say no
      fifty times. But one day you&rsquo;ll say&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s slight frame tautened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; she said, in a chill, clear voice
      calculated to set immeasurable spaces between them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a
      cave woman to be forced into marriage. Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;the ludicrous side
      of this imperious kind of wooing striking her suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t
      be so absurd, Geoffrey! You can&rsquo;t seize me by the hair and carry me
      off to your own particular hole in the rocks, you know.&rdquo; She began
      to laugh a little. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just go on being good friends&mdash;and
      forget that this has ever happened.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hand, but he took no notice of the little friendly
      gesture. There was a red gleam in his eyes, a smouldering glow that needed
      but a breath to fan it into flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak as if it were something that was over and done with,&rdquo;
      he said in a low, tense voice. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t; it never will
      be. I love you and want you, and I shall go on loving you and wanting you
      as long as I live. Jean&mdash;sweetest&rdquo;&mdash;his voice suddenly
      softened incredibly&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to be more gentle. But
      when a man loves as I do, he doesn&rsquo;t stop to choose his words.&rdquo;
      He stepped closer to her. &ldquo;Oh! You little, little thing! Why, I
      could pick you up and carry you off to my cave with two fingers. Jean,
      when will you marry me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His big frame towered beside her. He paid no more attention to her
      dismissal of him than if she had not spoken, and she was conscious of an
      odd feeling of impotence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to have understood me,&rdquo; she said forcing
      herself to speak composedly. &ldquo;If I loved you, you&rsquo;d have no
      need to &lsquo;carry me off&rsquo; to your cave. I&rsquo;d come&mdash;gladly.
      But I don&rsquo;t love you, Geoffrey. And I shall never marry a man I don&rsquo;t
      love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll marry me,&rdquo; he returned stubbornly. &ldquo;Do you
      think I&rsquo;m going to give you up so easily? If you do, you mistaken. I
      love you, and I&rsquo;ll teach you to love me&mdash;when you&rsquo;re my
      wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two pairs of eyes met, a challenging defiance flashing between them.
      Jean shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be mad,&rdquo; she said contemptuously, and turned
      to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same instant his hands gripped her shoulders and he swung her round
      facing him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mad!&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely. &ldquo;Yes, I am mad&mdash;mad
      for you. You little cold thing! Do you know what love is&mdash;man&rsquo;s
      love?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his arms close round her like a vice of steel, lifting her off
      her feet, so that she hung helpless in his embrace. For a moment his eyes
      burned down into hers&mdash;the hot flame of desire that blazed in them
      seeming almost to scorch her&mdash;the next, he had hidden his face
      against the warm white curve of her throat, where a little affrighted
      pulse throbbed tempestuously. Then, as though the touch of her snapped the
      last link of his self-control, his mouth sought hers, and he was kissing
      her savagely, crushing her soft, wincing lips beneath his own. Her slender
      body swayed helpless as a reed in his strong grip, while the tide of his
      passion, like some fierce, untamable flood, swept over her resistlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he released her, she stood back from him, staggering a
      little. Instinctively he stretched out his hand to steady her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t... touch me!&rdquo; she panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words came driven between clenched teeth, chokingly. Her face was
      milk-white and her eyes blazed at him out of its pallor. She felt as if
      her heart were beating in her throat, stifling her, and for a little space
      sheer physical stress held her silent But she fought it back, asserting
      her will against her weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; There was bitter anger in her still tones.
      &ldquo;How dare you touch me&mdash;like that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift movement she passed her handkerchief across her lips and then
      let it fall on the ground as though it were something unclean. He winced
      at the gesture; for a moment the passion died out of his face and a rueful
      look, almost of schoolboy shame, took its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;feel like that about it?&rdquo; he said, nodding
      towards the handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just like that,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Do you think&mdash;if I
      had known&mdash;I would ever have risked being alone with you? But I
      thought we were friends&mdash;I never dreamed I couldn&rsquo;t trust you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said unsteadily. The sight of her
      slender, defiant figure and lovely, tilted face, with the scornful lips he
      had just kissed showing like a scarlet stain against its whiteness, sent
      the blood rioting through his veins once more. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll... you&rsquo;ll
      never be able to trust any man who loves you, Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts flew to Blaise. She would trust herself with him&mdash;now,
      at any time, always. But then, perhaps&mdash;the after thought came like a
      knife-thrust&mdash;perhaps he did not care!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man who&mdash;loved me,&rdquo; she said dully, &ldquo;would not
      do what you&rsquo;ve just done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would&mdash;sooner or later. Unless his veins ran milk and
      water!&rdquo; He drew a step nearer and stood staring down at her
      sombrely. &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re like, I wonder? With your
      great golden eyes and your maddening mouth and that little cleft in your
      white chin.... You&rsquo;re angry because I kissed you. I wonder I didn&rsquo;t
      do it before! I&rsquo;ve wanted to, dozens of times. But I wanted your
      love more than a passing kiss. I&rsquo;ve waited for that&mdash;waited all
      these weeks. And now you refuse it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve not even <i>understood</i>
      that you&rsquo;re all earth and heaven to me. God! How blind you must have
      been!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent. Her anger was waning, giving place to a certain
      distressful comprehension of the mighty force which had suddenly broken
      bondage in the man beside her. Dimly, from her own knowledge of the
      yearning bred of the loved one&rsquo;s nearness, she envisaged what these
      last weeks must have meant to a man of Burke&rsquo;s temperament. Was it
      any wonder, when suddenly made to realise that the woman he loved not only
      did not love him in return, but had failed even to sense his love for her,
      that his stormy spirit had rebelled&mdash;flung off its shackles? An
      element of self-reproach tinctured her thoughts. In a measure the fault
      had been hers; her self-absorption was to blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I have been
      blind, Geoffrey. Indeed&mdash;indeed I would have prevented all this if I
      had known, if I had guessed. But, honestly, I just thought of you&mdash;you
      and Judith&mdash;as friends.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you really did,&rdquo; he said slowly, almost
      incredulously. Then, as though in swift corollary: &ldquo;Jean, is there
      anyone else?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The question drove at her with its sudden grasp of the truth. Her face
      grew slowly drawn and pinched-looking beneath his merciless gaze and her
      lips moved speechlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it <i>is</i> that, is it? And does he&mdash;has he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey, you are insufferable!&rdquo; The words came wrung from
      her in quick, low protest. &ldquo;You have no right&mdash;no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he admitted, touched by the
      stricken look in her eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d no business to ask that. For
      the moment, it&rsquo;s enough that you don&rsquo;t love me.... But I shall
      never give you up, Jean. You&rsquo;re mine&mdash;my woman!&rdquo; The
      light of possession flared up once more in his eyes. &ldquo;Do you
      remember I told you once that, if a man makes up his mind, he can get his
      own way over most things? Well, it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused a moment, then abruptly swung round on his heel and without a
      word of farwell, strode away across the garden towards the gate by which
      he had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the latch clicked into its place behind him, Jean was conscious of a
      sudden tremor, of a curious, uncontrollable fear, as though his words held
      something of prophecy. The man&rsquo;s dominating personality seemed to
      swamp her, overwhelming her by its sheer physical force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of her sinister dream, and of the dream Burke&rsquo;s
      threat: &ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s too late to try and run away. If you don&rsquo;t
      come into my parlour, you&rsquo;ll be stamped with the mark of the beast
      forever</i>,&rdquo; returned to her with a disagreeable sense of menace.
      She shivered a little and, picking up her basket, almost ran back to the
      house, as though seeking safety.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;CROSS-PURPOSES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the task of
      arranging her roses in the various bowls and vases Baines had set in
      readiness for her, Jean found a certain relief from the feeling of terror
      which had invaded her. Something in the homely everydayness of the
      occupation served to relax the tension of her mind, keyed up and
      overwrought by the stress of her interview with Burke, and it was with
      almost her usual composure of manner that she greeted Blaise when
      presently he joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve raided the rose garden to-day,&rdquo; she said,
      smilingly indicating the mass of scented blossom that lay heaped up on the
      table. &ldquo;I expect when Johns finds out he will proceed to meditate
      upon something for my benefit with boiling oil in it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Johns was one of the gardeners to whom Jean&rsquo;s joyous and wholesale
      robbery of his first-fruits was a daily cross and affliction. Only
      chloroform would ever have reconciled him to the cutting off of a solitary
      bloom while still in its prime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise regarded the tangle of roses consideringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder you found time to gather so many. When I passed by the
      rose garden, you were&mdash;otherwise occupied.&rdquo; The quietly uttered
      comment sent the blood rushing up into Jean&rsquo;s face. When had he
      passed? What had he seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      She kept her eyes lowered, seemingly intent upon the disposition of some
      exquisite La France roses in a black Wedge-wood bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she looked at him she would have surprised a restless pain in the keen
      eyes he bent upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke very gently&mdash;&ldquo;have I&mdash;to
      congratulate you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to preserve her poise of indifference when the man she
      loved put this question to her, but she contrived it somehow. Women become
      adepts in the art of hiding their feelings. The conventions demand it of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s answer fluttered out with the airy lightness of a butterfly
      in the sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure I can&rsquo;t say, unless you tell me upon what grounds?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know of none, then&rdquo;&mdash;swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nibbled the end of a stalk and surveyed the Wedge-wood bowl
      critically. Tormarin felt like shaking her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said gruffly, &ldquo;let me suggest you revise your
      methods. The woman who plays with Geoffrey Burke might as safely play with
      an unexploded bomb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice betrayed him, revealing the personal element behind the
      proffered counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean glanced at him between her lashes. So that was it! He was jealous&mdash;jealous
      of Burke! At last something had happened to pierce the joints of his
      armour of assumed indifference! Her heart sang a little pæan of
      thanksgiving, and all that was woman in her rose bubbling to meet the
      situation. In an instant she had recaptured her aplomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I rather enjoy playing with unexploded bombs,&rdquo; she
      returned meditatively. &ldquo;There are always&mdash;possibilities&mdash;about
      them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are&rdquo;&mdash;grimly. &ldquo;And it is precisely against
      those possibilities that I am warning you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s rather bad taste on your part to
      warn me against a man who is admittedly on terms of friendship with you
      all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;steadily. &ldquo;Nor should I care
      if it were. When it&rsquo;s a matter of you and your safety, the question
      of taste doesn&rsquo;t enter into the thing at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My safety?&rdquo; jeered Jean softly. (It was barely half an hour
      since Burke had inspired her with that sudden fear of him and of his
      compelling personality!)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if not your safety, at least your happiness,&rdquo; amended
      Blaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to interest yourself, but really my
      happiness has nothing whatever to do with Geoffrey Burke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed the question at her, and there was that in his tone which set
      her pulses athrill, quenching the light-hearted spirit of banter that had
      led her to torment him. It was the note of restrained passion which she
      had heard before in his voice, and which had always power to move her to
      the depths of her being.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly true.&rdquo; She faltered a little. &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;forcing
      herself to a defiance that was in reality a species of self-defence&mdash;&ldquo;I
      fail to see that it concerns you, Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It concerns me in so far as Burke is not the sort of man that a
      woman can make a friend of. It&rsquo;s all or nothing with him. And if you
      don&rsquo;t intend to give him all, you&rsquo;d better give him&mdash;nothing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance, grave and steady, met hers, and she knew then, of a certainty,
      that he had witnessed the scene which had taken place in the rose garden,
      when Burke had held her in his arms and the flood of his passion had risen
      and overwhelmed her. He had witnessed that&mdash;and had misunderstood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of a fierce resentment against him. It mattered nothing
      to her that, in the light of her nonchalant answers to his questions, he
      was fully justified in the obvious conclusion he had drawn. She did not
      stop to think whether her anger was reasonable or unreasonable. She was
      simply furious with him for suspecting her of flirting&mdash;odious word!&mdash;with
      Geoffrey Burke. Well, if he chose to think thus of her, let him do so! She
      would not trouble to explain&mdash;to exculpate herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded him with stormy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please understand, Blaise, that I want neither your advice nor your
      criticism. If I choose to make a friend of Geoffrey Burke&mdash;or of any
      other man&mdash;I shall do so without asking your permission or approval.
      What I do, or don&rsquo;t do, is no business of yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they faced each other, his eyes, stormy as her own, dark with
      anger. His hands clenched themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could,&rdquo; he said hoarsely, &ldquo;I would <i>make</i> it
      my business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled round and left the room without another word. Jean stood
      staring dazedly at the blank panels of the door which had closed behind
      him. She wanted to laugh... or to cry. To laugh, because with every sullen
      word he revealed the thing he was so sedulously intent on keeping from
      her. To cry, because he had taken her pretended indifference at its face
      value, and so another film of misunderstanding had risen to thicken the
      veil between them&mdash;the veil which he would not, and she, being a
      woman, could not, draw aside.

      CHAPTER XIX&mdash;THE SPIDER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ROBABLY masculine
      obtuseness and the feminine faculty for dissimulation are together
      responsible for more than half the broken hearts with which the highways
      of life are littered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Recalcitrant Parent, the Other Woman&mdash;be she never so guileful&mdash;or
      the Other Man, as the case may be, are none of them as potent a menace to
      the ultimate happy issue of events as the mountain of small
      misunderstandings which a man and a maid in love are capable of piling up
      for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man is prone to see only that which the woman intends he shall&mdash;and
      no self-respecting feminine thing is going to unveil the mysteries of her
      heart until she is very definitely assured that that is precisely what the
      man in the case is aching for her to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she dissimulates with all the skill which Nature and a few odd thousand
      years or so of tradition have taught her and pretends that the Only Man in
      the World means rather less to her than her second-best shoe buckles. With
      the result that he probably goes silently and sadly away, convinced that
      he hasn&rsquo;t an outside chance, while all the time she is simply
      quivering to pour out at his feet the whole treasure of her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this respect Blaise and Jean blundered as egregiously as any other
      love-befogged pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following upon their quarrel over the matter of Jean&rsquo;s attitude
      towards Geoffrey Burke, Tormarin retreated once again into those
      fastnesses of aloof reserve which seemed to deny the whole memory of that
      &ldquo;magic moment&rdquo; at Montavan. And Jean, just because she was
      unhappy, flirted outrageously with the origin of the quarrel, finding a
      certain reckless enjoyment in the flavour of excitement lent to the
      proceedings by the fact that Burke was in deadly earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Playing with an &ldquo;unexploded bomb&rdquo; at least sufficed to take
      her thoughts off other matters, and enabled her momentarily to forget
      everything for which forgetting seemed the only possible and sensible
      prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you can&rsquo;t forget things by yourself. Solitude is memory&rsquo;s
      closest friend. So Jean, heedless of consequences, encouraged Burke to
      help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne sometimes sighed a little, as she watched the two go off
      together for a long morning on the river, or down to the tennis-court,
      accompanied, on occasion, by Claire Latimer and Nick to make up the set.
      But she held her peace. She was no believer in direct outside interference
      as a means towards the unravelment of a love tangle, and all that it was
      possible to do, indirectly, she had attempted when she revealed to Jean
      the history of Blaise&rsquo;s marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did, however, make a proposal which would have the effect of breaking
      through the present trend of affairs and of throwing Blaise and Jean more
      or less continuously into each other&rsquo;s company. She was worldly wise
      enough to give its due value to the power of propinquity, and her
      innocently proffered suggestion that she and her two sons and Jean should
      all run up to London for a week, before the season closed, was based on
      the knowledge of how much can be accomplished by the skilful handling of a
      <i>partie carrée</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suggestion was variously received. By Blaise, indifferently; by Jean,
      with her natural desire to know more of the great city she had glimpsed en
      route augmented by the knowledge that a constant round of sight-seeing and
      entertainment would be a further aid towards the process of forgetting; by
      Nick, the sun of whose existence rose and set at Charnwood, with open
      rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why go to be baked in London, madonna, when we might remain here in
      the comparative coolth of the country?&rdquo; he murmured plaintively to
      his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone at the moment, and Lady Anne regarded him with twinkling
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankly, Nick, because I want Jean for my daughter-inlaw. No other
      reason in the world. Personally, as you know, I simply detest town during
      the season.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a Machiavelli in petticoats! I&rsquo;d never have believed it
      of you, madonna. S&rsquo;elp me, I wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may. And you&rsquo;ve got to back me up, Nick. No
      philandering with Jean, mind! You&rsquo;ll leave her severely alone and
      content yourself with the company of your aged parent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aged fiddlestick!&rdquo; he jeered. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for
      that white hair of yours, I&rsquo;d tote you round as my youngest sister.
      &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t believe&rdquo;&mdash;severely&mdash;&ldquo;that
      it <i>is</i> white, really. I believe your maid powders it for you every
      morning, just because you were born in sin and know that it&rsquo;s
      becoming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was settled that the first week of July should witness a general
      exodus from Staple, and meanwhile the June days slipped away, and Tormarin
      sedulously occupied himself in adding fresh stones to the wall which he
      thought fit to interpose between himself and the woman he loved. While
      Jean grew restless and afraid, and flung herself into every kind of
      amusement that offered, wearing a little fine under the combined mental
      and physical strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire, perceiving the nervous tension at which the girl was living, was
      wistfully troubled on her friend&rsquo;s behalf, and confided her anxious
      bewilderment to Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Blaise must be crazy,&rdquo; she declared one day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      perfectly convinced that he&rsquo;s in love with Jean, and yet he appears
      prepared to stand by while Geoffrey Burke completely monopolises her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I own I can&rsquo;t understand the fellow. He&rsquo;ll wake up
      one day to find that she&rsquo;s Burke&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; cried Claire hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were pacing up and down one of the gravelled alleys that intersected
      the famous rhododendron shrubbery at Charnwood, and, as she spoke, Claire
      cast a half-frightened glance in the direction of the house. She knew that
      Sir Adrian was closeted with his lawyer, and that he was, therefore, not
      in the least likely to emerge from the obscurity of his study for some
      time to come. But as long as he was anywhere on the place, she was totally
      unable to rid herself of the hateful consciousness of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reminded her of some horrible and loathsome species of spider, at times
      remote and motionless in the centre of his web&mdash;that web in which,
      body and soul, she had been inextricably caught&mdash;but always liable to
      wake into sudden activity, and then pounce mercilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hope not!&rdquo; she repeated, shivering a little. &ldquo;If
      she only knew what marriage to the wrong man means!... And I&rsquo;m
      certain Geoffrey is the wrong man. Why on earth does Blaise behave like
      this?&rdquo;&mdash;impatiently. &ldquo;Anyone might think&mdash;Jean
      herself might think&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t care! And I&rsquo;m positive he
      does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, he&rsquo;s a fool. Good Lord!&rdquo;&mdash;moodily
      kicking a pebble out of his path&mdash;&ldquo;imagine any sane man, with a
      clear road before him, <i>not taking it!!</i>&rdquo; He swung round
      towards her suddenly. &ldquo;Claire, if there were only a clear road&mdash;for
      us! If only I could take you away from all this!&rdquo; his glance
      embracing the grey old house, so beautiful and yet so much a prison, which
      just showed above the tops of the tall-growing rhododendrons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush! Hush!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire glanced round her affrightedly, as though the very leaves and
      blossoms had ears to hear and tongues to repeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One never knows&rdquo;&mdash;she whispered the words barely above
      her breath&mdash;&ldquo;where he is. He might easily be hidden in one of
      the alleys that run parallel with this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The skunk!&rdquo; muttered Nick wrathfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s that?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire drew suddenly closer to him, her face blanching. A sound&mdash;the
      light crunching of gravel beneath a footstep&mdash;had come to her
      strained ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick! Did you hear?&rdquo; she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of keen anxiety overspread his face. For himself, he did not care;
      Adrian Latimer could not hurt him. But Claire&mdash;his &ldquo;golden
      narcissus&rdquo;&mdash;what might he not inflict on her as punishment if
      he discovered them together?
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment it was all he could do to repress a shout of relief. The
      steps had quickened, rounded the corner of the alley, and revealed&mdash;Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re mighty glad to see you,&rdquo; remarked Nick, as she
      joined them. &ldquo;We thought you were&mdash;the devil himself&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s safe for half an hour yet,&rdquo; Jean reassured
      them, &ldquo;I asked Tucker&rdquo;&mdash;the Latimer&rsquo;s butler, who
      worshipped the ground Claire walked on&mdash;&ldquo;and his solicitor is
      still with him. Otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have risked looking for you&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
      &ldquo;I knew Nick was over here, and Sir Adrian might have followed me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure he hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Claire nervously.
      &ldquo;He is so cunning&mdash;so stealthy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if he had, you&rsquo;re doing nothing wrong,&rdquo; maintained
      Jean stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Everything</i> I do is wrong&mdash;in his eyes,&rdquo; returned
      Claire bitterly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes the misery of it. If I
      were really wicked, really unfaithful, I should feel I deserved anything I
      got. But it&rsquo;s enough if I&rsquo;m just happy for a few minutes with
      a friend for him to want to punish me, to&mdash;to suspect me of any evil.
      Sometimes I feel as if I couldn&rsquo;t bear it any longer!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung out her arms in a piteous gesture of abandonment. There was
      something infinitely touching and forlorn about her as she stood there, as
      though appealing against the hideous injustice of it all, and, with a
      little cry Jean caught her outstretched hands and drew her into her
      embrace, folding her closely in her warm young arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick had turned aside abruptly, his face rather white, his mouth working.
      His powerlessness to help the woman he loved half maddened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Jean was crooning little, inarticulate, caressing sounds above
      Claire&rsquo;s bowed head, until at last the latter raised a rather white
      face from her shoulder and smiled the small, plucky smile with which she
      usually managed to confront outrageous fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you so much,&rdquo; she said with a glint of humour in her
      tones. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been dears, both of you. It&rsquo;s awfully
      nice to&mdash;to let go, sometimes. But I&rsquo;m quite all right again,
      now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you are,&rdquo; replied Jean cheerfully, &ldquo;perhaps
      you can bear up against the shock of too much joy. We want you to have
      &lsquo;a day out.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;A day out&rsquo;?&rdquo; repeated Claire. &ldquo;What do you
      mean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean we&rsquo;re organising a picnic to Dartmoor, and we want to
      fix it so that you can come too. Didn&rsquo;t you tell me that Sir Adrian
      was going to be away one day this week? Going away, and not returning till
      the next day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire nodded, her eyes dancing with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;oh, yes! He has to go up to London on business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s the day we&rsquo;ll choose. Heaven send it be
      fine!&rdquo;&mdash;piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how I&rsquo;d love it!&rdquo; exclaimed Claire. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
      been on the Moor for such a long time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never been there at all,&rdquo; supplemented Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick! Nick!&rdquo; Claire turned to him excitedly. &ldquo;Did you
      know of this plan? And why didn&rsquo;t you tell me about it before?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, a slow smile curving his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never thought of it,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You see&rdquo;&mdash;explanatorily&mdash;&ldquo;when
      I&rsquo;m with you, I can&rsquo;t think of anything else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick, I won&rsquo;t have you making barefaced love to a married
      woman under my very nose,&rdquo; protested Jean equably. And the shadow of
      tragedy that had lowered above them a few minutes earlier broke into a
      spray of cheery fun and banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem very gay to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The cold, sneering tones fell suddenly across the gay exchange of jokes
      and laughter that ensued, and the trio looked up to see the tall, lean,
      black-clad figure of Sir Adrian standing at the end of the path, awaiting
      their approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean, as to Claire, occurred the analogy of a malevolent spider on the
      watch. Even the man&rsquo;s physical appearance seemed in some way to
      convey an unpleasant suggestion of resemblance&mdash;his long, thin,
      sharply-jointed arms and legs, his putty-coloured face, a livid mask lit
      only by a pair of snapping, venomous black eyes, half hidden between
      pouched lids that were hardly more than hanging folds of wrinkled skin,
      his long-lipped, predatory mouth with its slow, malicious smile. Jean
      repressed a little shudder of disgust as she responded to his sneering
      comment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are&mdash;quite gay, Sir Adrian. It&rsquo;s a fine day, for one
      thing, and the sun&rsquo;s shining, and we&rsquo;re young. What more do we
      want?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What more, indeed? Except&rdquo;&mdash;bowing mockingly&mdash;&ldquo;the
      beauty with which a good Providence has already endowed you. You are a
      lucky woman, Miss Peterson; your cup is full. My wife is not, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;regarding
      her appraisingly&mdash;&ldquo;quite so beneficently dowered by Providence,
      so it remains for me to fill her cup up to the brim.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and as the black, pin-point eyes beneath the flabby lids
      detected the slight stiffening of Claire&rsquo;s slender figure, his long,
      thin lips widened into a sardonic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to the brim,&rdquo; he repeated with satisfaction. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      a husband&rsquo;s duty, isn&rsquo;t it, Mr. Brennan?&rdquo;&mdash;addressing
      Nick with startling suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should know better than I, Sir Adrian,&rdquo; retorted Nick,
      &ldquo;seeing that you have experience of matrimony, while I have none.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have hopes&mdash;aspirations, isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;
      pursued Latimer suavely. There was an undercurrent of disagreeable
      suggestion in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick was acutely conscious that his keenest aspiration at the moment was
      to knock the creature down and jump on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must find you a wife, eh, Claire? Eh, Miss Peterson?&rdquo;
      continued Sir Adrian, rubbing the palm of one bony hand slowly up and down
      over the back of the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Claire, you would like
      to see so&mdash;intimate&mdash;a friend as Mr. Brennan happily married,
      wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to see him happy,&rdquo; answered Claire with tight
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so&mdash;just so,&rdquo; agreed her husband in a queer
      cackling tone as though inwardly amused. &ldquo;Well, get him a wife, my
      dear. You are such friends that you should know precisely the type of
      woman which appeals to him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded and turned to go, gliding away with an odd shuffling gait, and
      muttering to himself as he went: &ldquo;Precisely the type&mdash;precisely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he disappeared from view down one of the branching paths of the
      shrubbery, an odious little laugh, half chuckle, half snigger, came to the
      ears of the three listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s face set itself in lines that made her look years older
      than her age.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go,&rdquo; she whispered unevenly. &ldquo;We
      shan&rsquo;t be able to talk any more now that he knows you are here. He&rsquo;ll
      be hovering round&mdash;<i>somewhere</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;d better be going. Come along, Nick. And let us know,
      Claire&rdquo;&mdash;dropping her voice&mdash;&ldquo;as soon as you have
      found out for certain what day he goes away. You can telephone down to us,
      can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ll ring up when he&rsquo;s out of the house some time,&rdquo;
      she answered &ldquo;Or send a message. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll manage to let
      you know somehow. Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;stretching out her arms ecstatically&mdash;&ldquo;imagine
      a day, of utter freedom! A whole day!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX&mdash;THE SHADOW OF THE FUTURE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>OLD of gorse and
      purple of heather, a shimmering haze of heat quivering above the
      undulating green of the moor, and somewhere, high up in the cloud-flecked
      blue above, the exultant, piercingly sweet carol of a lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How utterly perfect this is!&rdquo; sighed Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lying at full length on the springy turf, her chin cupped in her
      hands, her elbows denting little cosy hollows of darkness in the close
      mesh of green moss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin, equally prone, was beside her, his eyes absorbing, not the open
      vista of rolling moor, hummocked with jagged tors of brown-grey stone, but
      the sun as it rioted through a glory of red-brown hair and touched
      changeful gleams of gold into topaz eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a queer little throb in Jean&rsquo;s voice, the low note of
      almost passionate delight which sheer beauty never failed to draw from
      her. It plucked at the chords of memory, and Tormarin&rsquo;s thoughts
      leaped back suddenly to that day they had spent together in the mountains,
      when, as they emerged from the pinewood&rsquo;s gloom to the revelation of
      the great white-pinacled Alps, she had turned to him with the rapt cry:
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so beautiful that it makes one&rsquo;s heart ache!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began involuntarily, then
      checked himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;M&mdash;m?&rdquo; she queried. The little interrogative
      murmur was tantalising in its soft note of intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jean of the last few days&mdash;the days immediately following their
      quarrel&mdash;had temporarily vanished. The beauty of the Moor had taken
      hold of her, and all the mockery and bitter-sweetness which she had
      latterly reserved for Tomarin&rsquo;s benefit was absent from her
      manner. She was just her natural sweet and wholesome self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;M&mdash;m? Do I remember&mdash;what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking what a pagan little beauty-lover you are! You
      worshipped the Alps. Now you are worshipping Dartmoor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should call it &lsquo;pagan,&rsquo;
      though. I should say it was equally Christian. I think we were <i>meant</i>
      to love beauty. Otherwise there wouldn&rsquo;t have been such a lot of it
      about. God didn&rsquo;t put it around just by accident.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite probably you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed Blaise. &ldquo;In
      which case you must be&rdquo;&mdash;he smiled&mdash;&ldquo;an excellent
      Christian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively I believe they&rsquo;re talking theology!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s voice, girlishly gay and free from the nervous restraint
      which normally dulled its cadence of youth, broke suddenly on their ears,
      as she and Nick, rounding the corner of a big granite boulder, discovered
      the two recumbent forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You disgustingly lazy people!&rdquo; she pursued indignantly.
      &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s dashing wildly to and fro unpacking the lunch
      baskets, while you two are just lounging here in blissful idleness!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s chronic with me,&rdquo; murmured Tormarin lazily.
      &ldquo;And anyway, Claire, neither you nor Nick appear to be precisely
      overtaxing yourselves bearing nectar and ambrosia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I carried some of the drinks up this confounded hill,&rdquo;
      submitted Nick. &ldquo;And damned heavy they were, too! I can&rsquo;t <i>think</i>&rdquo;&mdash;plaintively&mdash;&ldquo;why
      people should be so thirsty at a picnic. I&rsquo;m sure Baines has shoved
      in enough liquid refreshment to float a ship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise be!&rdquo; interpolated Blaise piously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve done our share,&rdquo; supplemented Claire. &ldquo;And
      now we&rsquo;re going to the gipsy who lives here to have our fortunes
      told.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before lunch,&rdquo; subjoined Nick, &ldquo;so that in case they&rsquo;re
      depressingly bad you can stay us with flagons afterwards.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sat up suddenly, her face alight with interest &ldquo;Do you mean
      that there is a real gipsy who tells real fortunes?&rdquo; she demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;quite real. She&rsquo;s supposed to be extraordinarily
      good,&rdquo; replied Nick. &ldquo;She is a lady of property, too, since
      she has acquired a few square yards of the Moor from the Duchy and built
      herself a little shanty there. She rejoices in the name of Keturah
      Stanley.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have my fortune told,&rdquo; murmured Jean
      meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you,&rdquo; volunteered Blaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a suddenly alert look in his face, as though he, too, would like
      to hear Jean&rsquo;s fortune told.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all go, then,&rdquo; said Claire. &ldquo;You must let
      Keturah tell yours as well, Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, no,&rdquo; he answered briefly. &ldquo;I know my fortune
      quite as well as I have any wish to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin&rsquo;s curt refusal somewhat quenched the gaiety of the moment,
      and rather soberly they all four made their way down the slope to where,
      in a little sheltered hollow at the foot of the tor, the sunlight glinted
      on the corrugated iron roofing of a tiny two-roomed hut, built of wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, sitting on an inverted pail and composedly puffing away at a clay
      pipe, they discovered a small, shrivelled old woman, sunning herself, like
      a cat, in the midday warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head as they approached, revealing an immensely old,
      delicately-featured face, which might have been carved out of yellow
      ivory. It was a network of wrinkles, colourless save for the piercing
      black eyes that sparkled beneath arched black brows, while the fine-cut
      nostrils and beautifully moulded mouth spoke unmistakably of race&mdash;of
      the old untainted blood which in some gipsy families has run clear,
      unmixed and undiluted, through countless generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an odd dignity about the shrunken, still upright figure as she
      rose from her seat&mdash;the freedom of one whose neck has never bowed to
      the yoke of established custom, whose kingdom is the sun and sea and earth
      and air as God gave them to Adam&mdash;and when the visitors had explained
      their errand, and she proceeded to answer them in the soft, slurred
      accents of the Devon dialect, the illiterate speech seemed to convey a
      strange sense of unfitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire and Nick were the first to dare the oracle. The old woman beckoned
      to them to follow her into the cottage, while Tormarin and Jean waited
      outside, and when they emerged once more, both were laughing, their faces
      eager and half excited like the faces of children promised some indefinite
      treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s given you luck, then?&rdquo; asked Jean, smiling in
      sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy interposed quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tezn&rsquo;t for me to give nor take away the luck. But I knaw
      that, back o&rsquo; they gert black clouds the young lady&rsquo;s so
      mortal feared of, the zun&rsquo;s shinin&rsquo; butivul. I tell &rsquo;ee,
      me dear&rdquo;&mdash;nodding encouragingly to Claire, while her keen old
      eyes narrowed to mere pin-points of light&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll zee
      it, yourself&mdash;and afore another year&rsquo;s crep&rsquo; by. &rsquo;Ess,
      fay! You&rsquo;ll knaw then as I tolled &rsquo;ee trew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a gesture that summoned Jean to follow her, she disappeared
      once more into the interior of the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean hesitated nervously in the doorway. For a moment she was conscious of
      an acute feeling of distaste for the impending interview&mdash;a dread of
      what this woman, whose eyes seemed the only live thing in her old, old
      face, might have to tell her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; she appealed to Blaise. And he nodded and
      followed her across the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scent of a peat fire came warm and fragrant to her nostrils as she
      stepped out of the sunlight into the comparative dusk of the little
      shanty, mingling curiously with an aroma of savoury stew which issued from
      a black pot hung above the fire, bubbling and chuckling as it simmered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy, as though by force of habit, gave a stir to its contents and
      then, settling herself on a three-legged stool, she took Jean&rsquo;s hand
      in her wrinkled, claw-like fingers and peered at its palm in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your way baint so plain tu zee as t&rsquo;other young lady&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
      she muttered at last, in an odd, sing-song tone. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s life
      an&rsquo; death an&rsquo; fire an&rsquo; flame afore yu zee the sun shinin&rsquo;
      clear.... And if so be yu take the wrong turnin&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll niver
      zee it. And there&rsquo;ll be no postes to guide &rsquo;ee. Tez your awn
      sawl must tell &rsquo;ee how to walk through the darkness. For there&rsquo;s
      darkness comin&rsquo;... black darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, and the liquid in the black pot over the fire seethed up
      suddenly and filled the silence with its chuckling and gurgling, so that
      to Jean it seemed like the sound of some hidden malevolence chortling
      defiance at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman clutched her hand a little tighter, turning the palm so that
      the light from the tiny window fell more directly upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a castle waitin&rsquo; for &rsquo;ee, me dear,&rdquo;
      she resumed in the same sing-song voice as before. &ldquo;I can zee it so
      plain as plain. But yu won&rsquo;t never live there wi&rsquo; the one yu
      luve, though you&rsquo;m hopin&rsquo; tu. I see ruin and devastation all
      around it, and the sky so red as blid above it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She released Jean&rsquo;s hand slowly, and her curiously bright eyes
      fastened upon Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I tell the gentleman&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo; she asked,
      stretching out her withered claw to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he drew it away hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he said, attempting to speak lightly. &ldquo;This
      lady&rsquo;s fortune isn&rsquo;t sufficiently encouraging for me to
      venture.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The gipsy&rsquo;s eyes never left his face. She nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be. For tez the zaim luck and zaim ill-lack
      will come to yu as comes to thikke maid. There&rsquo;s no ring given or
      taken, but you&rsquo;m bound together so fast and firm as weddin&rsquo;-ring
      could bind &rsquo;ee.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt her face flame scarlet in the dusk of the tiny room, and she
      turned and made her way hastily out into the sunshine once more, thankful
      for the eager queries of Nick and Claire, which served to bring back to
      normal the rather strained atmosphere induced by the gipsy&rsquo;s final
      comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they climbed the side of the tor once more, Jean relapsed into silence.
      More than once, more than twice, since she had come to England, she had
      been vaguely conscious of some hidden menace to her happiness, and now the
      gipsy had suddenly given words to&rsquo; her own indefinite premonition of
      evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For there&rsquo;s darkness comin&rsquo;... black darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a relief to join the rest of the picnic party, who were clamouring
      loudly for their lunch, good-humouredly indignant with the wanderers for
      keeping them waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another five minutes,&rdquo; announced Burke, &ldquo;and we should
      have begun without you. Not even Lady Anne could have kept us under
      restraint a moment longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was quite a large one, augmented by a good many friends from
      round about the neighbourhood, and amid the riotous fun and ridiculous
      mishaps which almost invariably accompany an alfresco meal, Jean contrived
      to throw off the feeling of oppression generated by Keturah&rsquo;s
      prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke, having heaped her plate with lobster mayonnaise, established
      himself beside her, and proceeded to catechise her about her recent
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the lady&mdash;what&rsquo;s her name, Keturah?&mdash;tell you
      when you were going to marry me?&rdquo; he demanded in an undertone, his
      dare-devil eyes laughing down at her impudently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she did not. She only foresees things that are really going to
      happen,&rdquo; retorted Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is&rdquo;&mdash;composedly. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t be
      much good at her job if she missed seeing it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jean affected to consider&mdash;&ldquo;the nearest she
      got to it was that she saw &lsquo;darkness coming... black darkness.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Under cover of the general preoccupation in lunch and conversation, Burke&rsquo;s
      hand closed suddenly over hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You little devil!&rdquo; he said, half amused, half sulky. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      make you pay for that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But out here, in the wind-swept, open spaces of the Moor, Jean felt no
      fear of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First catch your hare&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she retaliated
      defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He regarded her tensely for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your advice,&rdquo; he said briefly. Then he added:
      &ldquo;Did you know that I&rsquo;m driving you back in my cart this
      afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Various cars and traps and saddle horses had brought the party together at
      the appointed rendezvous&mdash;a little village on the outskirts of the
      Moor, and Jean had driven up with Blaise in one of the Staple cars. She
      looked at Burke now, in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are not,&rdquo; she replied quickly. &ldquo;I shall
      go back as I came&mdash;in the car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite impossible. It&rsquo;s broken down. They rashly brought on
      the lunch hampers in it, across that God-forsaken bit of moor road&mdash;with
      disastrous consequences to the car&rsquo;s internals. So that you and
      Tormarin have got to be sorted into other conveyances. And I&rsquo;ve
      undertaken to get you home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s face fell a little. Throughout the drive up to the Moor
      Blaise had seemed less remote and more like his old self than at any time
      since their quarrel, and she could guess that this arrangement of Burke&rsquo;s
      was hardly likely to conduce towards the continuance of the new peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will Blaise get home?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can squeeze him into her car, Judy says. It&rsquo;ll be a
      tight fit, but he can cling on by his eyelashes somehow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it would be a better arrangement if you drove Blaise and I
      went back in the car with your sister,&rdquo; suggested Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s certainly not room for two extra in the car. There
      isn&rsquo;t really room for one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wouldn&rsquo;t be two. You would drive Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me. I should do nothing of the sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&rdquo;&mdash;incredulously&mdash;&ldquo;that you would
      refuse?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I should invent an armour-plated reason. A broken spring in the
      dog-cart or something. But I do mean that if I don&rsquo;t drive you, I
      drive no one.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean looked at him vexedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said uncertainly, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t have a
      fuss at a picnic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; agreed Burke. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll
      have to give in.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rather thought so, too. There didn&rsquo;t seem any way out of it.
      She knew that Burke was perfectly capable, under cover of some supposed
      mishap to his trap, of throwing the whole party into confusion and
      difficulty, rather than relinquish his intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she yielded at last, resignedly. &ldquo;Have
      your own way, you obstinate man.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to,&rdquo; he replied coolly. &ldquo;Now&mdash;-and
      always.&rdquo;
    </p>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;I</span> DON&rsquo;T
      think I want any champagne,&rdquo; said Claire smilingly, as Nick filled a
      glass and handed it to her. &ldquo;Being utterly free like this produces
      much the same effect. I feel drunk, Nick&mdash;drunk with happiness. Oh,
      why can&rsquo;t I be always free&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off abruptly in her speech, her face whitening, and stared past
      Nick with dilated eyes. Her lips remained parted, just as when she had
      ceased speaking, and the breath came between them unevenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick followed the direction of her glance. But he could see nothing to
      account for her suddenly stricken expression of dismay. A man in chauffeur&rsquo;s
      livery, vaguely familiar to him, was approaching, and it was upon him that
      Claire&rsquo;s eyes were fixed in a sick gaze of apprehension. It reminded
      Nick of the look of a wounded bird, incapable of flight, as it watches the
      approach of a hungry cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked quickly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
      matter? For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t look like that, Claire!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, with difficulty, she wrenched her eyes away from that sleek,
      conventional figure in the dark green livery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see who it is?&rdquo; she asked in a harsh, dry
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Nick could answer, the man had made his way to Claire&rsquo;s side
      and paused respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, my lady,&rdquo; he said, touching his hat, &ldquo;Sir
      Adrian sent me to say that he&rsquo;s waiting for you in the car just
      along the road there.&rdquo; He pointed to where, on the white ribbon of
      road which crossed the Moor not far from the base of the tor, a stationary
      car was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire, her face ashen, turned to Nick in mute appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir Adrian? I thought he left for London this morning?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick shot the question fiercely at the chauffeur, but the man&rsquo;s face
      remained respectfully blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. Sir Adrian drove as far as Exeter and then returned.
      Afterwards we drove on here, sir, and they told us in the village we
      should find you at Shelston Tors.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the other members of the party were becoming aware that some
      contretemps had occurred. Claire&rsquo;s white, stricken face was evidence
      enough that something was amiss, and simultaneously Lady Anne and Jean
      hurried forward, filled with apprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Claire?&rdquo; asked Lady Anne, suspecting bad news of
      some kind. &ldquo;What has happened?&rdquo; Recognising the Charnwood
      livery, she turned to the chauffeur and continued quickly: &ldquo;Has Sir
      Adrian met with an accident?&rdquo; She could conceive of no other cause
      for the man&rsquo;s unexpected appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lady. Sir Adrian is waiting in the car for her ladyship.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waiting in the car?&rdquo; repeated Jean and Lady Anne in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little group of friends drew closer together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what it means?&rdquo; broke out Claire in a low
      voice of intense anger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been all a trick&mdash;a trick!
      He never meant to go to London at all. He only <i>pretended</i> to me that
      he was going, so that I should think that I was free and he could trap me.&rdquo;
      She looked at Nick and Jean significantly. &ldquo;He must have overheard
      us&mdash;that day in the shrubbery at Charnwood&mdash;you remember?&rdquo;
      They both nodded. &ldquo;And then planned to humiliate me in front of half
      the county.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t go back with him?&rdquo; exclaimed Nick hotly.
      He swung round and addressed the chauffeur stormily. &ldquo;You can damn
      well tell your master that her ladyship will return this evening with the
      rest of the party.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s face twitched. As far as it is
      possible for a well-drilled servant&rsquo;s face to express the human
      emotion of compassion, his did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be no good, sir,&rdquo; he said in a low voice. &ldquo;He
      means her ladyship to come. &lsquo;Go and fetch her away, Langton,&rsquo;
      was his actual words to me. I didn&rsquo;t want the job, sir, as you may
      guess.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not coming, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; declared
      Nick determinedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I must, Nick&mdash;I must go,&rdquo; cried Claire in distress.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I <i>daren&rsquo;t</i> stay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think she must go, Nick dear,&rdquo; she said persuasively.
      &ldquo;It would he&mdash;-wiser.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s damnable!&rdquo; ejaculated Nick furiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      only done to insult her&mdash;to humiliate her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire smiled a little wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be used to that by now,&rdquo; she said a trifle
      shakily. &ldquo;But Lady Anne is right&mdash;I must go.&rdquo; She turned
      to the chauffeur, dismissing him with a little air of dignity that, in the
      circumstances, was not without its flavour of heroism. &ldquo;You can go
      on ahead, Langton, and tell Sir Adrian that I am coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man touched his hat and moved off obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick and I will walk down to the car with you,&rdquo; said Lady
      Anne. She was fully alive to the fact that her escort might contribute
      towards ameliorating the kind of reception Claire would obtain from her
      husband. &ldquo;Jean dear, look after everybody for me for a few minutes,
      will you? And,&rdquo; raising her voice a little, &ldquo;explain that
      Claire has been called home suddenly, as Sir Adrian was not well enough to
      make the journey to town, after all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lady Anne&rsquo;s well-meant endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of
      the rest of the party was of comparatively little use. Although to many of
      them Claire was personally an entire stranger&mdash;since Sir Adrian
      intervened whenever possible to prevent her from forming new friendships&mdash;the
      story of her unhappy married life was practically public property in the
      neighbourhood, and it was quite evident that to all intents and purposes
      the detestable husband had actually insisted on her returning with him,
      exactly as a naughty child might be swept off home by an irate parent in
      the middle of a jolly party.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was impossible to stem the flood of gossip, and though most of it was
      kindly enough, and wholeheartedly sympathetic to Lady Latimer, Jean&rsquo;s
      cheeks burned with indignation that Claire&rsquo;s dignity should be thus
      outraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of the afternoon was spoilt for her, and Nick&rsquo;s stormy
      face when he, together with Lady Anne, rejoined the rest of the party did
      not help to lighten her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, Nick,&rdquo; she whispered compassionately,
      when presently the opportunity of a few words alone with him occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not. I think I&rsquo;m
      glad. This ends it. No woman can be expected to put up with public
      humiliation of that sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick!&rdquo; There was a sharp note of fear in Jean&rsquo;s voice.
      &ldquo;Nick, what do you mean? What are you going to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an ugly expression on the handsome boyish-looking face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know soon enough,&rdquo; was all he vouchsafed. And
      swung away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt troubled. She had never seen Nick before with that set, still
      look on his face&mdash;a kind of bitter concentration which reminded her
      forcibly of his brother&mdash;and she rather dreaded what it might
      portend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts were still preoccupied with the afternoon&rsquo;s unpleasant
      episode, and with the possible consequences which might accrue, as she
      climbed into Burke&rsquo;s high dog-cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had a fleeting notion of claiming Claire&rsquo;s vacant seat for
      the homeward run, but had dismissed it since actually Claire&rsquo;s
      absence merely served to provide comfortable room for Blaise in the Willow
      Ferry car, which had held its full complement of passengers on the outward
      journey. Moreover, she reflected that any change of plan, now that she had
      agreed to drive back with Burke, might only lead to trouble. He was not in
      a mood to brook being thwarted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big, raking chestnut, on wires to be off, danced between the shafts of
      the dog-cart, irritably pawing the ground and jerking her handsome,
      satin-skinned head up and down with a restless jingle of bit and
      curb-chain. She showed considerable more of the white of a wicked-looking
      eye than was altogether reassuring as she fought impatiently against the
      compulsion of the steady hand which gripped the reins and kept her,
      against her will, at a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant she felt Jean&rsquo;s light foot on the step her excitement
      rose to fever heat. Surely this <i>must</i> mean that at last a start was
      imminent and that that firm, masterful pressure on the bit would be
      released!
    </p>
    <p>
      But Burke had leaned forward to tuck the light dust-rug round Jean&rsquo;s
      knees, and regarding this further delay as beyond bearing the chestnut
      created a diversion by going straight up in the air and pirouetting gaily
      on her hind legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s calm tones fell rebukingly on the quivering, sensitive ears,
      and down came two shining hoofs in response, as the mare condescended to
      resume a more normal pose. The next moment she was off at a swinging trot,
      breaking every now and again, out of pure exuberance of spirits, into a
      canter, sternly repressed by those dominating hands whose quiet mastery
      seemed conveyed along the reins as an electric current is carried by a
      wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; remarked Burke. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      settle down in a few minutes. It&rsquo;s only a &lsquo;stable ahead&rsquo;
      feeling she&rsquo;s suffering from. There&rsquo;s not an ounce of vice in
      her composition.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; replied Jean composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell him why. But within herself she knew that no woman would
      ever be afraid with Geoffrey Burke. Afraid of him, possibly, but never
      afraid that he would not be entire master of any situation wherein
      physical strength and courage were the paramount necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected a little grimly to herself that it was this very
      forcefulness which gave the man his unquestionable power of attraction.
      There is always a certain fascination in sheer, ruthless strength&mdash;a
      savour of magnificence about it, something tentatively heroic, which
      appeals irresistibly to that primitive instinct somewhere hidden in the
      temperamental make-up of even the most ultra-twentieth-century feminine
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jean was quite aware that she herself was not altogether proof against
      the attraction of Burke&rsquo;s dynamic virility.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another kind of strength which appealed to her far more. She
      knew this, too. The still, quiet force that was Tormarin&rsquo;s&mdash;deep,
      and unfathomable, and silent, of the spirit as well as of the body.
      Contrasted with the savage power she recognised in Burke, it was like the
      fine, tempered steel of a rapier compared with a heavy bludgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A penny for your thoughts!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean came out of her reverie with a start. She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get conceited. I was thinking about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice thoughts, I hope, then?&rdquo; suggested Burke. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      better&rdquo;&mdash;audaciously&mdash;&ldquo;to think well of your future
      husband.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gipsy&rsquo;s words flashed into Jean&rsquo;s mind: &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;m
      bound together so fast and firm as weddin-ring could bind </i>&rsquo;<i>ee,</i>&rdquo;
      and her face flamed scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true&mdash;at least as far as she was concerned&mdash;that no
      wedding-ring could bind her more firmly to Blaise than her own heart had
      already bound her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instinct to flirt with Burke was in abeyance. It was an instinct only
      born of heartache and unhappiness, and now that Blaise&rsquo;s mood was so
      much less cool and distant than, it had been, the temptation to play with
      unexploded bombs had correspondingly lost much of its charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be tiresome, Geoffrey,&rdquo; she said vexedly. &ldquo;If
      only you would make up your mind to be&mdash;just pals, I should think
      much better of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to think worse,&rdquo; he
      retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment they encountered a flock of sheep, ambling leisurely
      along towards them and blocking up the narrow roadway, and Jean was spared
      the necessity of replying by the fact that Burke immediately found his
      hands full, manoeuvring a path for the mare between the broad, curly backs
      of the bleating multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drover of the flock was, of course, a hundred yards or more behind his
      charges, negligently occupied in relighting his pipe, so that no
      assistance was to be looked for in that direction, and as the sheep bumped
      against the mare&rsquo;s legs and crowded up against the wheels of the
      trap in their characteristically maddening fashion, it required all Burke&rsquo;s
      skill and dexterity to make a way through the four-footed crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chestnut&rsquo;s own idea of dealing with the difficulty was to charge
      full speed ahead, an idea which by no means facilitated matters, and she
      fought her bit and fairly danced with fury as Burke checked her at almost
      every yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had nearly reached the open road again, and Jean, looking down on the
      sea of woolly backs, with the hovering cloud of hoof-driven dust above
      them, thought she could fully appreciate the probable feelings of the
      Israelites as they approached the further shore of the Red Sea. And it was
      just at this inauspicious moment that the drover, having lit his pipe to
      his satisfaction, looked up and grasped the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guilty conscience not only makes cowards, but is also prolific in the
      creation of fools, and the drover, stung into belated action by the
      consciousness of previous remissness, promptly did the most foolish thing
      he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He let off a yell that tore its way through every quivering nerve in the
      mare&rsquo;s body, and with a shout of, &ldquo;Round &rsquo;em, lad!&rdquo;
      sent his dog&mdash;a half-trained youngster&mdash;barking like a creature
      possessed, full tilt in pursuit of the sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      That settled it as far as the chestnut was concerned. With a bound she
      leapt forward, scattering the two or three remaining sheep that still
      blocked her path, and the next moment the light, high cart was rocking
      like a cockle-shell in a choppy sea, as she tore along, utterly out of
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily, for a couple of miles the road ran straight as a dart, and after
      the first gasp of alarm Jean found herself curiously collected and able to
      calculate chances. At the end of the two miles, she know, there came a
      steep declivity&mdash;a typical Devonshire hill, like the side of a house,
      which the British workman had repaired in his usual crude and inefficient
      manner, so that loose stones and inequalities of surface added to the
      dangers of negotiation. At the foot of this descent was a sharp double
      turn&mdash;a veritable death-trap. Could Burke possibly got the mare in
      hand before they reached the brow of the hill? Jean doubted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound now in all the world except the battering of the mare&rsquo;s
      hoofs upon the road and the screaming rush of the wind in their ears. The
      hedges flew past, a green, distorted blur. The strip of road fled away
      beneath them as though coiled up by some swift revolving cylinder; ahead,
      it ended sheer against a sky blue as a periwinkle, and into that blue they
      were rushing at thirty miles an hour. When they reached it, it would be
      the end. Jean could almost hear the crash that must follow, sense the
      sickening feeling of being flung headlong, hurled into space.... hurtling
      down into black nothingness.,..
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance sought Burke&rsquo;s face. His jaw was out-thrust, and she
      could guess at the clenched teeth behind the lips that shut like a
      rat-trap. His eyes gleamed beneath the penthouse brows, drawn together so
      that they almost met above his fighting beak of a nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an oddly detached manner she found herself reflecting on the dogged
      brute strength of his set face. If anyone could check that flying,
      foam-flecked form, rocketing along between the shafts like a red-brown
      streak, he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered how long he would be able to hold the beast&mdash;to hang on?
      She remembered having heard that, after a time, the strain of pulling
      against a runaway becomes too much for human nerves and muscles, and that
      a man&rsquo;s hands grow numb&mdash;and helpless! While the dead pull on
      the bit equally numbs the mouth of the horse, so that he, too, has no more
      any feeling to be played upon by the pressure of the hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes dropped to Burke&rsquo;s hands. With a little inward start of
      astonishment she realised that he was not attempting to pull against the
      chestnut. He was just holding... holding... steadying her, ever so little,
      in her mad gallop. Jean felt the mare swerve, then swing level again,
      still answering faintly to the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s hands were very still. She wondered vaguely why&mdash;now&mdash;he
      didn&rsquo;t pit his strength against that of the runaway. They must have
      covered a mile or more. A bare half-mile was all that still lay between
      them and disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as she watched Burke&rsquo;s hands, she saw them move, first one
      and then the other, sawing the bit against the tender corners of the mare&rsquo;s
      mouth. Jean was conscious of a faint difference in the mad pace of her.
      Not enough to be accounted a check&mdash;but still <i>something</i>, some
      appreciable slackening of the whirlwind rush towards that blue blur of sky
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as though Burke, too, sensed that infinitesimal yielding to the
      saw of the bit. For the first time, he gave a definite pull at the reins.
      Then he relaxed the pressure, and again there followed the same sawing
      motion and the fret of the steel bar against sensitive, velvet lips. Then
      another pull&mdash;the man&rsquo;s sheer strength against the mare&rsquo;s....
      Jean watched, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      And gradually, almost imperceptibly at first, the frenzied beat of the
      iron-shod hoofs became more measured as the chestnut shortened her stride.
      It was no longer merely the thrashing, thunderous devil&rsquo;s tattoo of
      sheer, panic-driven speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again Jean could hear Burke&rsquo;s voice, speaking to the
      frightened beast, chiding and reassuring in even, unhurried tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of no fear, only of an absorbing interest and excitement
      as to whether Burke would be able to impose his will upon the animal
      before they reached that precipitous hill the descent of which must
      infallibly spell &lsquo;destruction&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat very still, her hands locked together, watching... watching....

      CHAPTER XXII&mdash;&ldquo;WILLING OR UNWILLING!&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was over. A bare
      twenty yards from the brow of the bill the man had won, and now the mare
      was standing swaying between the shafts, shaking in every limb, her flanks
      heaving and the sweat streaming off her sodden coat in little rivulets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke was beside her, patting her down and talking to her in a little
      intimate fashion much as though he were soothing a frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re all in, aren&rsquo;t you, old thing?&rdquo; he
      murmured sympathetically. Then he glanced up at Jean, who was still
      sitting in the cart, feeling rather as though the end of the world had
      occurred and, in some surprising fashion, left her still cumbering the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s pretty well run herself out,&rdquo; he remarked.
      &ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t have any more trouble going home&rdquo;&mdash;smiling
      briefly. &ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; answered Jean a trifle flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You all right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thank you. You must be an excellent whip,&rdquo; she added.
      &ldquo;I thought the mare would never stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably even Jean hardly realised the fineness of the horsemanship of
      which she had just been a witness&mdash;the judgment and coolness Burke
      had evinced in letting the mare spend the first freshness of her strength
      before he essayed to check her mad pace; the dexterity with which he had
      somehow contrived to keep her straight; and finally, the consummate skill
      with which, that last half-mile, he had played her mouth, rejecting the
      dead pull on the reins&mdash;the instinctive error of the mediocre driver&mdash;which
      so quickly numbs sensation and neutralises every effort to bring a runaway
      to a standstill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I rather thought our number was up,&rdquo; agreed Burke
      absently. He was passing his hands feelingly over the mare to see if she
      were all right, and suddenly, with a sharp exclamation, he lifted one of
      her feet from the ground and examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cast a shoe and torn her foot rather badly,&rdquo; he announced.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we shall have to stop at the next village and get
      her shod. It&rsquo;s not a mile further on. You and I can have tea at the
      inn while she&rsquo;s at the blacksmith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a final caress of the steaming chestnut neck, he came back to the
      side of the cart, reins in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you drive her with a torn foot?&rdquo; queried Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. We&rsquo;ll have to go carefully down this hill, though.
      There are such a confounded lot of loose stones about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed into the dog-cart and very soon they had reached the village,
      where the chestnut, tired and subdued, was turned over to the blacksmith&rsquo;s
      ministrations while Burke and Jean made their way to the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tea was brought to them upstairs in a quaint, old-fashioned parlour
      fragrant of bygone times. Oaken beams, black with age, supported the
      ceiling, and on the high chimneypiece pewter dishes gleamed like silver,
      while at either end an amazingly hideous spotted dog, in genuine old
      Staffordshire, surveyed the scene with a satisfied smirk. Through the
      leaded diamond panes of the window was visible a glimpse of the Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an enchanting place!&rdquo; commented Jean, as, tea over, she
      made a tour of inspection, pausing at last in front of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke had been watching her as she wandered about the room, his expression
      moody and dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a famous resort for honeymooners,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;Do you think&rdquo;&mdash;enquiringly&mdash;&ldquo;it would be a
      good place in which to spend a honeymoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; replied Jean cautiously. &ldquo;If the people
      were fond of the country, and the Moor, and so on&mdash;yes. But they
      might prefer something less remote from the world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;&mdash;with detachment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not contemplating
      a honeymoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Burke crossed the room to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might as well settle that point now,&rdquo; he said quietly.
      &ldquo;Jean, when will you marry me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve answered that question before. It isn&rsquo;t fair of
      you to reopen the matter here&mdash;and now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t fair. In fact, I&rsquo;m
      not sure that it isn&rsquo;t rather a caddish thing for me to do, seeing
      that you can&rsquo;t get away from me just now. But all&rsquo;s fair in
      love and war. And it&rsquo;s both love and war between us two&rdquo;&mdash;grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two things don&rsquo;t sound very compatible,&rdquo; fenced
      Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only war till you give in&mdash;till you promise to
      marry me. Then&rdquo;&mdash;a smouldering light glowed in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;then
      I&rsquo;ll show you what loves means.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; she said, attempting to speak coolly,
      &ldquo;that it means war indefinitely then, Geoffrey. I can give you no
      different answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall!&rdquo; he exclaimed violently. &ldquo;I tell you, Jean,
      it&rsquo;s useless your refusing me. I won&rsquo;t <i>take</i> no. I want
      you for my wife&mdash;and, by God, I&rsquo;m going to have you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew away from him a little, backing into the embrasure of the window.
      The look in his eyes frightened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whether I will or no?&rdquo; she asked, still endeavouring to speak
      lightly. &ldquo;<i>My</i> feelings in the matter don&rsquo;t appear to
      concern you at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you came willingly&mdash;but, if you won&rsquo;t,
      I swear I&rsquo;ll marry you, willing or unwilling!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was standing close to her now, staring down at her with sombre,
      passion-lit eyes, and instinctively she made a movement as though to elude
      him and slip back again into the room. In the same instant his arms went
      round her and she was prisoned in a grip from which she was powerless to
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t struggle,&rdquo; he said, as she strove impotently to
      release herself. &ldquo;I could hold you from now till doomsday without an
      effort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a curious thrill in his voice, the triumphant, arrogant leap of
      possession. He held her pressed against him, and she could feel his chest
      heave with his labouring breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine&mdash;mine! My woman&mdash;meant for me from the
      beginning of the world&mdash;and do you think I&rsquo;ll give you up?...
      Give you up? I tell you, if you were another man&rsquo;s wife I&rsquo;d
      take you away from him! You&rsquo;re mine&mdash;every inch of you, body
      and soul. And I want you. Oh, my God, how I want you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go... Geoffrey...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words struggled from her lips. For answer his arms tightened round
      her, crushing her savagely, and she felt his kisses burning, scorching her
      face, his mouth on hers till it seemed as though he were draining her very
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he released her, she leant helplessly against the woodwork of
      the window, panting and shaken. Her face was white as a magnolia petal and
      her eyes dark-rimmed with purple shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint expression of compunction crossed Burke&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;I shall never be forgiven now,&rdquo; he muttered
      roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort Jean forced her tongue to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said in a voice out of which every particle of
      feeling seemed to have departed. &ldquo;You will never be forgiven.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A look of deviltry came into his eyes. He crossed the room and, locking
      the door, dropped the key into his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he remarked coolly, &ldquo;in that case, I&rsquo;d
      better keep you a prisoner here till you have promised to marry me. It&rsquo;s
      you I want. Your forgiveness can come after. I&rsquo;ll see to that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of his action was unexpected. Jean turned to the window,
      unlatched it, and flung open the casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t unlock that door at once, Geoffrey,&rdquo; she
      said quietly, &ldquo;I shall leave the room&mdash;this way&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a gesture that sufficiently explained her meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was very steady. Burke looked at her curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;you&rsquo;d jump out?&rdquo; he asked, openly
      incredulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes answered him. They were feverishly bright, with an almost
      fanatical light in them, and suddenly Burke realised that she was at the
      end of her tether, that the emotional stress of the last quarter of an
      hour had taken its toll of her high-strung temperament and that she might
      even do what she had threatened. He had no conception of the motive behind
      the threat&mdash;of the imperative determination which had leaped to life
      within her to endure or suffer anything rather than stay locked in this
      room with Burke, rather than give Blaise, the man who held her heart
      between his two hands, ground for misunderstanding or mistrusting her
      anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke fitted the key into the lock of the door and turned it sulkily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You prim little thing! I was only teasing you,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;Do you mean you&rsquo;re really as frightened as all that of&mdash;<i>what
      people may say?</i> I thought you were above minding the gossip of
      ill-natured scandal-mongers.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean grasped eagerly at the excuse. It would serve to hide the real motive
      of her impulsive action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No woman can afford to ignore scandal,&rdquo; she answered quickly.
      &ldquo;After all, a woman&rsquo;s happiness depends mostly on her
      reputation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s eyes narrowed suddenly. He looked at her speculatively, as
      though her words had suggested a new train of thought, but he made no
      comment. Somewhat abstractedly he opened the door and allowed her to pass
      out and down the stairs. Outside the door of the inn they found the mare
      and dog-cart in charge of an ostler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mare&rsquo;s foot&rsquo;s rather badly torn, sir,&rdquo;
      volunteered the man, &ldquo;but the blacksmith thinks she&rsquo;ll travel
      all right. Far to go, sir?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nine or ten miles,&rdquo; responded Burke laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was curiously silent on the way home. It was as though the chain of
      reasoning started by Jean&rsquo;s comment on the relation scandal bears to
      a woman&rsquo;s happiness still absorbed him. His brows were knit together
      morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean supposed he was probably reproaching himself for his conduct that
      afternoon. After all, she reflected, he was normally a man of decent
      instincts, and though the flood-tide of his passion had swept him into
      taking advantage of the circumstances which had flung them together in the
      solitude of the little inn, he would be the first to agree, when in a less
      lawless frame of mind, that his conduct had been unpardonable. Although,
      even from that, one could not promise that he would not be equally
      culpable another time!
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise had proved painfully correct in his estimate of the dangers
      attaching to unexploded bombs. Jean admitted it to herself ruefully. And
      she was honest enough also to admit that, with his warning ringing in her
      ears and with the memory of what had happened in the rose garden to
      illumine it, she herself was not altogether clear of blame for the
      incidents of the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      She <i>had</i> played with Burke, even encouraged him to a certain extent,
      allowing him to be in her company far more frequently than was altogether
      wise, considering the circumstance of his hot-headed love for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with somewhat of a mental start of surprise that she found herself
      seeking for excuses for his behaviour&mdash;actually trying to supply
      adequate reasons why she should overlook it!
    </p>
    <p>
      His brooding, sulky silence as he drove along, mile after mile, was not
      without its appeal to the inherent femininity of her. He did not try to
      excuse or palliate his conduct, made no attempt to sue for forgiveness. He
      loved her and he had let her see it; manlike, he had taken what the
      opportunity offered. And she didn&rsquo;t suppose he regretted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faintest smile twitched the comers of her lips. Burke was not the type
      of man to regret an unlawful kiss or two!
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious that&mdash;as usual, where he was concerned&mdash;her
      virtuous indignation was oozing away in the most discreditable and
      hopeless fashion. There was an audacious charm about the man, an
      attractiveness that would not be denied in the hot-headed way he went, all
      out, for what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other women, besides Jean had found it equally difficult to resist. His
      sheer virility, with its splendid disregard for other people&rsquo;s
      claims and its conscienceless belief that the battle should assuredly be
      to the strong, earned him forgiveness where, for misdeeds not half so
      flagrant, a less imperious sinner would have been promptly shown the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no woman&mdash;not even the women to whom he had made love without the
      excuse of loving&mdash;had ever shown Burke the door or given him the kind
      of treatment which he had thoroughly well merited twenty times over. And
      Jean was no exception to the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      At least he had some genuine claim on her forgiveness&mdash;the claim of a
      love which had swept through his very bung like a flame, the fierce
      passion of a man to whom love means adoration, worship&mdash;above all,
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what woman can ever long remain righteously angry with a man who loves
      her&mdash;and whose very offence is the outcome of the overmastering
      quality of that love? Very few, and certainly none who was so very much a
      woman, so essentially feminine as Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a very small voice, which she endeavoured to make airily
      detached, that she at last broke the silence which had reigned for the
      last six miles or so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to forgive you&mdash;more or less. One can&rsquo;t
      exactly quarrel with one&rsquo;s next door neighbour.&rdquo; Burke smiled
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t one?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s Judith to be considered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A rather curious expression came into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Judith to be
      considered.&rdquo; There was a hint of irony in the dry tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would complicate matters if I were not on speaking terms with
      her brother,&rdquo; pursued Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited for his answer, but none came. The threatened possibility
      contained in her speech appeared to have fallen on deaf ears, and the
      silence seemed likely to continue indefinitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean prompted him gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might, at least, say you are sorry for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For kissing you?&rdquo;&mdash;swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not. Kissing you&rdquo;&mdash;with deliberation&mdash;&ldquo;is
      One of the things I shall never regret. When I come to make my peace with
      Heaven and repent in sackcloth and ashes for my sins of omission and
      commission, I shan&rsquo;t include this afternoon in the list, I assure
      you. It was worth it&mdash;if I pay for it afterwards in hell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent for a moment. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll promise you one thing. I&rsquo;ll never kiss you
      again till you give me your lips yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled at the characteristic speech. She supposed this was as near an
      apology as Burke would ever get.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; she replied composedly.
      &ldquo;Because I shall never do that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flicked the chestnut lightly with the whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you will,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked at her somewhat enigmatically&mdash;&ldquo;that you will give me
      everything I want&mdash;some day.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;ON THE SIDE OF THE ANGELS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HROUGHOUT the day
      following that of the expedition to Dartmoor, Nick seemed determined to
      keep out of Jean&rsquo;s way. It was as though he feared she might force
      some confidence from him that he was loth to give, and, in consequence,
      deliberately avoided being alone with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the second day, however, as luck would have it, she encountered him in
      the corridor just outside her own sitting-room. He was striding blindly
      along, obviously not heeding where he was going, and had almost collided
      with her before he realised that she was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked himself backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he muttered, still without looking at
      her, and made as though to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean checked him with a hand on his sleeve. She had not watched the dogged
      sullenness of his face throughout yesterday to no purpose, and now, as her
      swift gaze searched it anew, she felt convinced that something fresh had
      occurred to stir him. It was impossible for Jean to see a friend in
      trouble without wanting to &ldquo;stand by.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick, old thing, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her unseeingly. &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Wrong?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Come in here and let&rsquo;s talk it out&mdash;whatever it is.&rdquo;
      With gentle insistence she drew him into her sitting-room. &ldquo;How,&rdquo;
      she said, when she had established him in an easy-chair by the open window
      and herself in another, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s gone wrong? Are you still
      boiling over about that trick Sir Adrian played on Claire the day of the
      picnic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke lightly&mdash;more lightly than the occasion warranted&mdash;of
      set purpose, hoping to reduce the tension under which Nick was obviously
      labouring. His face hurt her. The familiar lazy insouciance which was half
      its charm was blotted out of it by some heavy cloud of tragic
      significance. He looked as though he had not slept for days, and his eyes,
      the gaiety burnt out of them by pain, seemed sunken in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her blankly for a moment. Then he seemed to awaken to the
      meaning of her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;No. The boiling over part is done
      with&mdash;finished.... I&rsquo;m going to take her away from him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a curious precision. It frightened Jean far more than any
      impetuous outburst of anger could have done. She made no answer for a
      moment, but her mind worked rapidly. She did not doubt the absolute
      sincerity of his intention. This was no mere reckless boast of an angry
      lover, but the sane, considered aim and object of a man who has come, by
      way of some long agony of thwarting, to a set determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that, Nick?&rdquo; she asked at last, to gain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I mean it?&rdquo; he laughed. Then his hands gripped the arms of
      the chair and he leaned forward. &ldquo;I saw her&mdash;last evening after
      dinner.... Her shoulder was black.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp cry broke from Jean&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;not&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had struck her. There was one of the usual scenes when they got
      back from the Moor&mdash;and he struck her.... It&rsquo;s the first time
      he has ever actually laid hands on her. It&rsquo;s going to be the last&rdquo;&mdash;grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent. Her whole soul was in revolt against the half-mad,
      drug-ridden creature who was making of Claire&rsquo;s life a devil
      martyrdom; the instinct to protect her, to succour her in some way,
      asserting itself with almost passionate force. And yet&mdash;&mdash; She
      knew that Nick&rsquo;s way was not the right way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it must be the last time,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;But&mdash;but,
      Nick, your plan won&rsquo;t do, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick stiffened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think not?&rdquo; he said curtly. &ldquo;Can you suggest a better?&rdquo;
      Then, as Jean remained miserably silent: &ldquo;Nor can I. And one thing I
      swear&mdash;I won&rsquo;t leave the woman I love in the hands of a man who
      is practically a maniac, to be tortured day after day, mentally and
      physically, just whenever he feels like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It struck Jean as curious that Nick had been able, more or less, to keep
      himself in hand whilst Sir Adrian inflicted upon Claire whatever of mental
      and spiritual torture seemed good in his distorted vision. It was the fact
      that he had hurt her physically, laid his hand upon her in actual
      violence, which had scattered Nick&rsquo;s self-control to the four winds
      of heaven. To Jean herself, it seemed conceivable that the mental anguish
      of Claire&rsquo;s married life had probably far outstripped any mere
      bodily pain. Half tentatively she gave expression to her thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If you were a man, you&rsquo;d
      understand! I see red when I think of that damned brute striking the woman
      I love. It&mdash;it was sacrilege!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t it be&mdash;another kind of sacrilege&mdash;if you
      take her away with you, Nick?&rdquo; asked Jean very quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed dully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll divorce her, and then we shall marry,&rdquo; he
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so&rdquo;&mdash;steadily&mdash;&ldquo;it would be doing evil
      that good may come.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;&mdash;savagely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      easy enough for you to sit there moralising, perfectly placid and
      comfortable. Claire and I have borne all we can. It has been bad enough to
      care as we care for each other, and to live apart But when it means that
      Claire is to suffer unspeakable misery and humiliation while I stand by
      and look on&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s beyond human endurance. You&rsquo;re not
      tempted. You&rsquo;ve no conception what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sat very still and silent while Nick stormed out the bitterness of
      soul, recognising the truth of every word he littered&mdash;even of the
      gibes which, in the heedlessness of his own pain, he flung at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she got up and moved rather slowly across to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick,&rdquo; she said, and her eyes, looking into his, were very
      bright and clear and steady. Somehow for Nick they held the semblance of
      two flames, torches of pure light, burning unflickeringly in the darkness.
      &ldquo;Nick, every word you say is true. I&rsquo;m not tempted as you and
      Claire have been, and so it seems sheer cheek my interfering. But I&rsquo;m
      only asking you to do what I pray I&rsquo;d be strong enough to do myself
      in like circumstances. I don&rsquo;t believe any true happiness can ever
      come of running away from duty. And if ever I&rsquo;m up against such a
      thing&mdash;a choice like this&mdash;I hope to God I&rsquo;d be able to
      hang on... to run straight, even if it half killed me to do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quick, impassioned utterance ceased, and half shrinkingly Jean
      realised that she had spoken out of the very depths of her soul,
      crystallising in so many words the uttermost ideal and <i>credo</i> of her
      being. In some strange, indefinable fashion it was borne in on her that
      she had reached an epoch of her life. It was as when a musician, arrived
      at the end of a musical period, strikes a chord which holds the keynote of
      the ensuing passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered and looked at Nick beseechingly, suddenly self-conscious, as
      we most of us are when we find we have laid bare a bit of our inmost soul
      to the possibly mocking eyes of a fellow human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Nick&rsquo;s eyes were not in the least mocking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of that, some of the hardness seemed to have gone out of them, and
      his voice was very gentle, as, taking Jean&rsquo;s two hands in his, he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe <i>you</i> would run straight, little Jean&mdash;even if
      it meant tearing your heart out of your body to do it. But, you know, you&rsquo;re
      always on the side of the angels&mdash;instinctively. I&rsquo;m only a man&mdash;just
      an average earthy man&rdquo;&mdash;smiling ruefully&mdash;&ldquo;and my
      ideals all tumble down and sit on the ground in a heap when I think of
      what my girl&rsquo;s enduring as Latimer&rsquo;s wife. I believe I might
      stick my part of the business&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t stick it for her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; urged Jean, &ldquo;if you go away together, Nick,
      it&rsquo;s she who&rsquo;ll pay, you know. The woman always does.
      Supposing&mdash;supposing Sir Adrian <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> divorce her&mdash;refuses
      to? It would be just like him to punish her that way. What about Claire&mdash;then?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>would</i> divorce her,&rdquo; protested Nick harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Honestly, I believe he would get undiluted
      satisfaction out of the fact that, as long as he lived, he could stand
      between Claire and everything that a normal woman wants&mdash;home, and a
      sheltered life, and the knowledge that no one can &lsquo;say things&rsquo;
      about her. Oh, Nick, Nick! Between you&mdash;you and Sir Adrian&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      make an outcast of Claire, make her life a worse hell with you than it is
      without you.&rdquo; She paused, then went on more quietly: &ldquo;Have you
      said anything to her about this&mdash;told her what you want her to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet&mdash;not definitely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean breathed a quick sigh of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t! Promise me you won&rsquo;t, Nick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might refuse, after all,&rdquo; he suggested, evading a direct
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Refuse! You know her better than that. If you wanted Claire to make
      a burnt-offering of herself for your benefit to-morrow, you know she&rsquo;d
      do it! And&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;laughing a little hysterically&mdash;&ldquo;pretend,
      too, that she enjoyed the process of being grilled! No, Nick, it&rsquo;s
      up to you to&mdash;to just go on helping to make her life bearable, as you
      have done for the last two years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s asking too much of me, Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick spoke a little thickly. He was up against one of man&rsquo;s most
      primitive instincts&mdash;the instinct to protect and comfort and cherish
      the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s asking everything of you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean waited. She felt that she had gained a certain amount of ground&mdash;that
      Nick&rsquo;s resolution had weakened a little in response to her pleading,
      but she feared to drive him too far. She fancied she could hear steps
      crossing the hall below. If someone should come upstairs and disturb them
      now, while things were still trembling in the balance&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Nick,&rdquo; she began to speak again hurriedly. &ldquo;You
      believe I&rsquo;m your pal&mdash;yours and Claire&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he replied quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you do care a bit about me?&rdquo;&mdash;smiling a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the third woman in my world, Jean. After Claire and my
      mother.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, to please me&mdash;for nothing else in the world, if you
      like, but because I ask it&mdash;will you let things stay as they are for
      a few weeks longer? Just that little while, Nick? We&rsquo;re going to
      London next week. That&rsquo;ll make a break&mdash;bring us all back to a
      calmer, more everyday outlook on things. Will you wait? Sir Adrian may
      never strike Claire again. And it wouldn&rsquo;t be fair&mdash;just now,
      at a time when she is feeling horribly bitter and humiliated from that&mdash;that
      insult&mdash;to ask her to go away with you. Give her a fair chance to
      decide a big question like that when things are at their normal level&mdash;not
      when they are worse than usual. To ask her now would be to take advantage
      of the feeling she must have, just at this moment, that her life is
      unbearable. It wouldn&rsquo;t be playing the game.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer, and Jean waited with increasing trepidation. She was
      sure now that she could hear footsteps. Someone had mounted the stairs and
      was coming along the corridor towards her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nick!&rdquo; The low, agitated whisper burst from her as the steps
      halted outside the door. &ldquo;Promise me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed an eternity before he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I promise. You&rsquo;ve won for the moment&mdash;&lsquo;Saint
      Jean&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her, rather sadly. Before she could reply, Blaise&rsquo;s
      voice sounded outside the door, asking if he might come in, and with a
      feeling of intense relief that the battle was won for the moment, Jean
      gave the required permission. As his brother entered the room, Nick
      quitted it, brushing past him abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin&rsquo;s eyes questioned Jean&rsquo;s;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been discussing Sir Adrian,&rdquo; she explained, as the
      door closed behind Nick. &ldquo;And&mdash;and Claire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded comprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor old Nick!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s damned rough on
      him. Latimer ought to be carefully and quickly chloroformed out of the
      way. He&rsquo;s as much a menace to society as a mad dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re very unhappy&mdash;Nick and Claire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder Claire doesn&rsquo;t chuck her husband,&rdquo; said
      Blaise. &ldquo;And take whatever of happiness she can get out of the
      world.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know you don&rsquo;t mean that. You don&rsquo;t really believe
      in snatching happiness&mdash;at all costs.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d let precious little stand in the way. If I were Nick I
      think I should do it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But being you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean did not know what unaccountable impulse induced her to give a
      personal and individual twist to what had been developing almost into an
      academic discussion. Perhaps it was the familiar, unsatisfied longing to
      hear Blaise himself define the thing which kept them apart&mdash;even
      though, since Lady Anne&rsquo;s disclosure, she could guess only too well
      what it was. Or perhaps it was the faint, tormenting hope that one day his
      determination would weaken and his love sweep away all barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her contemplatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes the past makes claims upon a man which forbid him to
      snatch at happiness. I don&rsquo;t believe in any man&rsquo;s shirking his
      just punishment for the evil he has done. What he has brought on himself,
      that he must bear. But Nick and Claire have had no part in bringing about
      their own tragedy. They are just the sport of chance&mdash;of an ill fate.
      They are morally free to take their happiness in a way in which I shall
      never be free to take mine, as long as I live.&rdquo; He regarded her
      steadily. &ldquo;There are certain things for which I have proved myself
      unfitted&mdash;with which it is evident I am not to be trusted. And one of
      those is the safeguarding of any woman&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt her throat contract. It would always be the same, then! The long
      tentacles of the past would reach out eternally into the future. The woman
      who had been his wife&mdash;the woman who had destroyed herself, and, in
      so doing, hanged a millstone of remorse about his neck&mdash;would stand
      forever at the gateway of the garden of happiness, her dead lips silently
      denying him&mdash;and, with him, the woman who loved him&mdash;the right
      to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort Jean answered that part of his speech which had reference
      only to Claire and Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are other ways, though, in which they have no moral right. I
      grant that Claire was persuaded, almost driven into marrying Sir Adrian by
      her parents, but, after all, we each have our individual free will. She <i>could</i>
      have refused to obey them. Or, if she felt there were reasons why she must
      marry him&mdash;the material advantage to her parents, and so on, why, she
      ought to have reckoned the cost I don&rsquo;t mean to be hard, Blaise&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
      She broke off wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;hard!&rdquo; He laughed a little, as though amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;only one must try to be fair all round&mdash;to look at
      things <i>straight</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned her chin on her palm and her eyes grew thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but it seems to me that we weren&rsquo;t meant
      to run away from things&mdash;hard things. If a man and a woman marry,
      they must accept their responsibilities&mdash;not evade them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So absorbed was she in her trend of thought that she never realised how
      directly this speech must strike at Blaise himself. His face changed
      slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, of course,&rdquo; he said abruptly. &ldquo;You&mdash;generally
      are. And if all women were like you, it would be easy enough.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dwelt with a curious intentness on the pure outline of her face;
      on the parted, tenderly curved lips, and the golden eyes with their
      momentary touch of the idealist and the dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if the quiet intensity of his regard drew her, for slowly she
      turned her head and met his gaze, flushing suddenly and faltering under
      it. The consciousness of him, of his nearness, swept her from head to
      foot, and it seemed to her as though now, in this moment, they were in
      closer touch, nearer understanding, than they had ever been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreamer and idealist vanished and it was all at once just sheer woman,
      passionate and wistful and tremulous, and infinitely alluring, that looked
      at him out of the golden eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a stifled exclamation he caught her hands in his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beloved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the whole of a man&rsquo;s forbidden, thwarted love vibrated in the
      word as he spoke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he bent his head, and for a moment his lips were against her soft
      palms....
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood very still and quiet when he had gone, realising in every
      quivering nerve of her that whatsoever the future might bring&mdash;even
      though Blaise might choose to shut himself away from her again as in the
      past and the dividing wall between them rise as high as heaven&mdash;she
      knew now, without any shadow of doubt or questioning, that he loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the burning utterance of a single word, in the pressure of passionate,
      renouncing lips, the assurance had been given, and nothing could ever take
      it away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spread out her hands, palms upward, and looked at them curiously.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;AN UNEXPECTED MEETING
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;H</span> AVE you
      been <i>very</i> bored, Nick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The week in London had nearly run its course, and Lady Anne&rsquo;s eyes
      begged charmingly for a negative. Nick accorded it with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never bored with you, madonna; you know that,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;And hotel life is always more or less amusing. One comes
      across such queer types. There&rsquo;s one here this evening has been
      intriguing me enormously. At a little table by herself&mdash;do you see
      her? A tall, rather gorgeous-looking being&mdash;kind of cross between the
      Queen of Sheba and Lucretia Borgia.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne threw a veiled glance in the direction indicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she&rsquo;s a very handsome woman, obviously not English.&rdquo;
      Her eyes travelled onwards towards the door. &ldquo;I wish Blaise and Jean
      would hurry up,&rdquo; she added impatiently. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re taking
      an unconscionable time to dress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two latter had come in late from a sight-seeing expedition undertaken
      on Jean&rsquo;s behalf, and had only returned to the hotel just as Lady
      Anne and Nick were preparing to make their way in to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For such a deliberate matchmaker, you&rsquo;re a lot too impatient,
      madonna,&rdquo; commented Nick teasingly. &ldquo;That they should have
      stayed out together until the very last moment ought to have pleased you
      immensely.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne made a small grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it does&mdash;theoretically. Only from a practical and purely
      material point of view, everything else sinks into insignificance beside
      the fact that I am literally starving. Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;joyfully catching
      sight of Jean and Tormarin making their way up the room&mdash;&ldquo;Here
      they are at last! Collect our waiter, Nick, and let&rsquo;s begin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the late-comers appeared in the least embarrassed by the
      tardiness of their arrival, said they responded to tentative enquiries
      concerning their afternoon&rsquo;s amusement with a disappointing lack of
      self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne experienced an inward qualm of misgiving. There seemed too calm
      and tranquil a camaraderie between the two to please her altogether. It
      was as though the last few days had brought about a silent understanding
      between them&mdash;a wordless compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up the menu and assumed an absorption in its contents which she
      was far from feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we all going to eat?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I think we
      must hurry a little, or we shall be late for the play. Then I shall lose
      the exquisite thrill of seeing the curtain go up.&rdquo; Tormarin looked
      entertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it still thrill you, you absurdly youthful person?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it does. I always consider that the quality of the thrill
      produced by the rise of the curtain is the measure of one&rsquo;s capacity
      for enjoyment. When it no longer thrills me, I shall know that I am
      getting old and bored, and that I only go to the theatre to kill time and
      because everyone else goes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner proceeded leisurely in spite of Lady Anne&rsquo;s admonition that
      they should hurry, and presently Nick, who had glanced across the room
      once or twice as though secretly amused, remarked confidentially:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lucretia Borgia lady is taking a quite uncommon interest in
      someone of our party. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t flatter myself that
      she&rsquo;s lost her heart to me, as I&rsquo;ve only observed this
      development since Jean and Blaise joined us. Blaise, I believe it&rsquo;s
      you who have won her devoted&mdash;if, probably, somewhat violent&mdash;affections.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lucretia Borgia lady? Which is she?&rdquo; enquired Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see her, because you are sitting with your back to
      her,&rdquo; replied Nick importantly. &ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t manners to
      screw your head round in a public restaurant&mdash;even although the
      modern reincarnation of an unpleasantly vengeful lady may be sitting just
      behind you. But if you&rsquo;ll look into that glass opposite you&mdash;a
      little to the right side of it&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see who I mean. She&rsquo;s
      quite unmistakable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean tilted her head a little and peered slantwise into the mirror which
      faced her. It was precisely at the same moment that Nick&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lucretia
      Borgia lady&rdquo; looked up for the second time from her <i>pêche</i>
      Melba, and Jean found herself gazing straight into the dense darkness of
      the eyes of Madame de Varigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered in
      astonishment. &ldquo;It is the Comtesse de Varigny!&rdquo; She turned to
      Lady Anne, adding explanatorily: &ldquo;You remember, madonna, I told you
      about her? She chaperoned me at Montavan, after Glyn had departed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The recognition had been mutual. Madame de Varigny had half-risen from her
      seat and was poised in an attitude of expectancy, smiling and gesturing
      with expressive hands an invitation to Jean to join her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go across and speak to her,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;I
      can&rsquo;t imagine what she is doing in London.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you, too, met this rather splendid-looking personage at
      Montavan?&rdquo; enquired Nick of his brother, as Jean quitted the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never spoke to her. I saw her once, on the night of a fancy-dress
      ball at the hotel, arrayed as Cleopatra.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;d look the part all right,&rdquo; commented Nick. &ldquo;She
      gives me the impression of being one of those angel-and-devil-mixed kind
      of women&mdash;the latter flavour preponderating. I should rather feel the
      desirability of emulating Agag in any dealings I had with her. Good Lord!&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a lively accession of interest&mdash;&ldquo;Jean&rsquo;s bringing her over
      here. By Jove! She really is a beautiful person, isn&rsquo;t she. Like a
      sort of Eastern empress.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Varigny wishes to be presented to you, Lady Anne,&rdquo;
      said Jean, and proceeded to effect introductions all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember seeing you with Mees Peterson at Montavan,&rdquo;
      remarked the Countess, as she shook hands with Blaise, her dark eyes
      resting on him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Join us and finish your dinner at our table,&rdquo; suggested Lady
      Anne hospitably.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Madame de Varigny protested volubly that she had already finished her
      meal, though she would sit and talk with them a little if it was
      agreeable? It was&mdash;quite agreeable. She herself saw to that. No one
      could be more charming than she when she chose, and on this occasion she
      elected to make herself about as altogether charming as it is possible for
      a woman to be, entirely conquering the hearts of Lady Anne and Nick. Her
      simple, childlike warm-heartedness of manner was in such almost ludicrous
      contrast to her majestic, dark-browed type of beauty that it took them
      completely by storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is only just a flying visit that I pay to England,&rdquo; she
      explained artlessly. &ldquo;It is a great good fortune that I should have
      chanced to encounter <i>ma chère Mees Peterson</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly an odd chance brought you to the same hotel,&rdquo;
      agreed Nick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it not?&rdquo;&mdash;delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, from the frank wonder and satisfaction she evinced at the
      coincidence, no one could possibly have surmised that the sole cause and
      origin of her &ldquo;flying visit&rdquo; was a short paragraph contained
      in the <i>Morning Post</i>, a copy of which, by her express order, had
      been delivered daily at Chateau Varigny ever since her return thither from
      the Swiss Alps. The paragraph referred simply to the arrival at Claridge&rsquo;s
      of Lady Anne Brennan, accompanied by her two sons and Miss Jean Peterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are you making a long stay in London?&rdquo; enquired Madame de
      Varigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We go back to Staple to-morrow.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The other&rsquo;s face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how unfortunate! I shall then see nothing of my dear Mees
      Peterson.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed so distressed that Lady Anne&rsquo;s kind heart melted within
      her, albeit it accorded ill with her plans to increase the number of her
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going on to the theatre,&rdquo; she said impulsively.
      &ldquo;If you have no other engagement, why not come with us? There will
      be plenty of room in our box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny professed herself enchanted. Curiously enough, she
      seemed to have no particular wish to draw Jean into anything in the nature
      of a private talk, but appeared quite content just to take part in the
      general conversation, while her eyes rested speculatively now upon Jean,
      now upon Tormarin, as though they afforded her an abstract interest of
      some kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at the theatre, where from her corner seat she was able to envisage
      the other occupants of the box, she seemed almost as much interested in
      them as in the play that was being performed on the stage. Once, as
      Tormarin leaned forward and made some comment to Jean, their two pairs of
      eyes meeting in a look of mutual understanding of some small joke or
      other, the quiet watcher smiled contentedly, as though the little byplay
      satisfied some inner questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the fall of the curtain at the end of the first act, she turned to
      Lady Anne, politely enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a charming play,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is no wonder
      the house is so full.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance strayed carelessly over the body of the auditorium, then was
      suddenly caught and held. A minute later she touched Jean&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is someone in the stalls trying to attract your
      attention,&rdquo; she observed quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as she spoke, Nick, too, became aware of the same fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Geoffrey Burke
      down below. I didn&rsquo;t know he was in town.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny found the effect upon her companions of this apparently
      innocent announcement distinctly interesting. It was as though a thrill of
      disconcerting consciousness ran through the other occupants of the box.
      Jean flushed suddenly and uncomfortably, and the dark, keen eyes that were
      watching from behind the fringe of dusky lashes noted an almost
      imperceptible change of expression flit across the faces of both Lady Anne
      and Tormarin. In neither case was the change altogether indicative of
      pleasure. Then, following quickly upon a bow of mutual recognition, the
      music of the orchestra suddenly ceased and the curtain went up for the
      second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more the curtain had fallen, and, to the hum of conversation suddenly
      released, the lights flashed up into being again over the auditorium.
      Simultaneously the door of Lady Anne&rsquo;s box was opened from the
      corridor outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo; said a voice&mdash;a pleasant voice with a
      gay inflection of laughter running through it as though its owner were
      quite sure of his welcome&mdash;and Burke, big and striking-looking in his
      immaculate evening kit, his ruddy hair flaming wickedly under the electric
      lights, strolled into the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands all round, his glance slightly quizzical as it met Jean&rsquo;s,
      and then Lady Anne presented him to the Comtesse de Varigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      It almost seemed as though something, some mutual recognition of a kindred
      spirit, flashed from the warm southern-dark eyes to the fiery red-brown
      ones, and when, a minute or two later, Burke established himself in the
      seat next Jean, vacated by Nick, he murmured in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you find that Eastern-looking charmer? I feel convinced I
      could lose my heart to her without any effort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean could hardly refrain from smiling. This was her first meeting with
      Burke since the occasion of the scene which had occurred between them in
      the little parlour at the &ldquo;honeymooners&rsquo; inn,&rdquo; and now
      he met her with as much composure and arrogant assurance as though nothing
      in the world, other than of a mutually pleasing and amicable nature, had
      taken place. It was so exactly like Burke, she reflected helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you had better go and make love to her,&rdquo; she suggested.
      &ldquo;There happens to be a husband in the background&mdash;a little
      hypochondriac with quite charming manners&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose
      you would consider that any obstacle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; retorted Burke placidly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite
      certain she can&rsquo;t be in love with him. Her taste would be more&mdash;robust,
      I should say. Where is she stopping?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Claridge&rsquo;s. We met her there this evening. I knew her in
      Switzerland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shall all come out to supper with me to-morrow:&mdash;-the
      Countess included.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean shook her head demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all be back at Staple to-morrow&mdash;the Countess
      excepted. You can take her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the supper must be to-night,&rdquo; replied Burke serenely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing in town, anyway?&rdquo; asked Jean. &ldquo;Is
      Judith with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Came up to see my tailor&rdquo;&mdash;laconically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the box to arrange matters with Lady Anne, and before the
      curtain rose on the last act it was settled that they should all have
      supper together after the play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Burke had once more resumed his seat next to
      Jean, Madame de Varigny, whose hearing, like her other senses, was
      preternaturally acute, caught a whispered plaint breathed into Nick&rsquo;s
      ear by Lady Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> that provoking, Nick, darling? Why on earth
      need Geoffrey Burke have turned up in town on our last evening? I was
      hoping, later on&mdash;if you and I were very discreet and effaced
      ourselves&mdash;that Blaise and Jean might settle things.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed upon the stage. There was no
      change in their expression to indicate that Lady Anne&rsquo;s plaintive
      murmur had at that moment supplied her with the key of the whole situation
      as it lay between Jean and the two men who were sitting one each side of
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the following evening, when, the Staple party having left town, she
      and Burke were dining alone together at a little restaurant in Soho, the
      knowledge she had gleaned bore fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke never quite knew what impulse it was that had prompted him, as he
      made his farewells after the supper-party, to murmur in Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s
      ear, &ldquo;Dine with me to-morrow night.&rdquo; It was as though the
      dark, mysterious eyes had spoken to him, compelling him to some sort of
      friendly overture which the shortness of his acquaintance with their owner
      would not normally have inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the coffee and cigarette stage of the little dinner had
      been reached that Madame de Varigny suddenly shot her dart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you come all the way up from this place, Coombe&mdash;Coombe
      Eavie?&mdash;to see Mees Peterson, and hey, presto! She vanish the next
      morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke stared at her almost rudely. The woman&rsquo;s perspicacity annoyed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came up to see my tailor,&rdquo; he replied curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mais parfaitement!</i>&rdquo; she laughed&mdash;low, melodious
      laughter, tinged with a frank friendliness of amusement which somehow
      smoothed away Burke&rsquo;s annoyance at her shrewd summing up of the
      situation. &ldquo;To see your tailor. <i>Naturellement!</i> But you were
      not sorry to encounter Mees Peterson also, <i>hein?</i> You enjoyed that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke&rsquo;s eyes gleamed at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think a dog enjoys looking at the bone that&rsquo;s out of
      reach?&rdquo; he said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is Mees Peterson, then, out of your reach? Me, I do not think
      so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke was moved to sudden candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She might not be, if it were not that there is another man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ce Monsieur Tor-ma-rin?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, confound him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We-ell&rdquo;&mdash;with a long-drawn inflection compact of gentle
      irony. &ldquo;You should be able to win against this Monsieur Tor-ma-rin.
      I think&rdquo;&mdash;regarding him intently&mdash;&ldquo;I think you <i>will</i>
      win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke shook his head gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had first innings. He met her abroad somewhere&mdash;rescued her
      in the snow or something. That rescuing stunt always pays with a woman.
      All <i>I</i> did&rdquo;&mdash;with a short, harsh laugh&mdash;&ldquo;was
      nearly to break her neck for her out driving one day recently!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she engaged to Monsieur Tormarin?&rdquo; asked Madame do Varigny
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Luckily, there&rsquo;s some old affair in the past holds him
      back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall marry her,&rdquo; she declared with conviction. &ldquo;See,
      Monsieur Bewrke&mdash;<i>aïe, aïe, quel nom!</i> I am <i>clairvoyante,
      prophétesse</i>, and I tell you that you weel marry zis leetle brown Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her foreign accent strengthened with her increasing emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke looked dubious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid your clairvoyance will fail this journey madame.
      She&rsquo;ll probably marry Tormarin&mdash;unless&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes
      glinting&mdash;&ldquo;I carry her off by force.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny shook her head emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>no!</i> I do not see it like that. <i>Eh bien!</i> If she
      become <i>fiancée</i>&mdash;engaged to him&mdash;you shall come to me, and
      I will tell you how to make sure that she shall not marry him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Non, non!</i> Win her your own way. Only, if you do not succeed,
      if Monsieur Tormarin wins her&mdash;why, then, come to visit me at Château
      Varigny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That night a letter written in the Comtesse de Varigny&rsquo;s flowing
      foreign handwriting sped on its way to France.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matters work towards completion,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;My visit
      here has chanced <i>bien à propos</i>. There is another would-be-lover
      besides Blaise Tormarin. I have urged him on to win her if he can, for if
      I have not wrongly estimated Monsieur Tormarin&mdash;and I do not think I
      have&mdash;he is of the type to become more deeply in love and less able
      to master his feelings if he realises that he has a rival. At present he
      refrains from declaring himself. The opposition of a rival will probably
      drive him into a declaration very speedily. When the dog sees the bone
      about to be taken from him&mdash;he snaps! So I encourage this red-headed
      lion of a man, Monsieur Burke, to pursue his <i>affaire du cour</i> with
      vigour. For if Blaise Tormarin becomes actually betrothed to Mademoiselle
      Peterson, it will make his punishment the more complete. I pray the God of
      Justice that it may not now be long delayed!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXV&mdash;ARRANGED BY TELEPHONE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE visit to
      London, if it had not been prolific in the results which Lady Anne had
      hoped for, had at least accomplished certain things.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had acted as a brake upon the swiftly turning wheels of two lives
      precariously poised at the top of that steep hill of which no traveller
      can see the end, but which very surely leads to heartbreak and disaster,
      and had sufficed, as Jean had suggested that it might, to restore Nick to
      a more normal and temperate state of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Claire had passed a long hour alone together the day after his
      return to Staple, and now that the first violent reaction, the first
      instinctive impulse of unbearable revolt from Sir Adrian&rsquo;s spying
      and brutality had spent itself they had agreed to shoulder once more the
      burden fate had laid upon them, to fight on again, just holding fast to
      the simple knowledge of their love for one another and leaving the
      ultimate issue to that great, unfathomable Player who &ldquo;hither and
      thither moves, and mates, and slays,&rdquo; not with the shadowed vision
      of our finite eyes but with the insight of eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had seen them coming hand in hand through the cool green glades of
      the wood where the great decision had been taken, and something in the two
      young, stern-set faces brought a sudden lump into her throat. She turned
      swiftly aside, avoiding a meeting, feeling as though here was holy ground
      upon which not even so close a friend as she could tread without
      violation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean herself the week in London had brought a certain, new tranquillity
      of spirit. Quite ordinarily and without effort&mdash;thanks to Lady Anne&rsquo;s
      skilful stage-management&mdash;she and Blaise had been constantly in each
      other&rsquo;s company, and, with the word &ldquo;Beloved&rdquo; murmuring
      in her heart like some tender undertone of melody, the hours they had
      shared together were no longer a mingled ecstacy and pain, marred by
      torturing doubts and fears, but held once more the old magic of that
      wonder-day at Montavan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, the dividing line did not seem to matter very much, now that she
      was sure that Blaise, on his side of it, was loving her just as she, on
      hers, loved him. Indeed, at this stage Jean made no very great demands on
      life. After the agony of uncertainty of the last few months, the calm
      surety that Blaise loved her seemed happiness enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other sharp edges of existence, too, had smoothed themselves down&mdash;as
      sharp edges have a knack of doing if you wait long enough. Burke seemed to
      have accepted her last answer as final, and now spared her the effort of
      contending further with his tempestuous love-making, so that she felt able
      to continue her friendship with Judith, and her consequent visits to
      Willow Ferry, with as little <i>gêne</i> as though the episode at the
      &ldquo;honeymooners&rsquo; inn&rdquo; had never taken place. She even
      began to believe that Burke was genuinely slightly remorseful for his
      behaviour on that particular occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently he had not made a confidant of his sister over the matter, for
      it was without the least indication of a back thought of any kind that she
      approached Jean on the subject of spending a few days with herself and
      Geoffrey at their bungalow on the Moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoff and I are going for a week&rsquo;s blow on Dartmoor, just by
      way of a &lsquo;pick-me-up.&rsquo; Come with us, Jean; it will do you good
      after stuffy old London&mdash;blow the cobwebs away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But here, at least, Jean felt that discretion was the better part of
      valour. It was true that Burke appeared fairly amenable to reason just at
      present, but in the informal companionship of daily life in a moorland
      bungalow it was more than probable that he would become less manageable.
      And she had no desire for a repetition of that scene in the inn parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, although the Moor, with its great stretches of gold and purple,
      its fragrant, heatherly breath and its enfolding silences, appealed to her
      in a way in which nothing else on earth seemed quite to appeal, pulling at
      her heartstrings almost as the nostalgia for home and country pulls at the
      heartstrings of a wanderer, she returned a regretful negative to Judith&rsquo;s
      invitation. So Burke and Mrs. Craig packed up and departed to Three Fir
      Bungalow without her, and life at Staple resumed the even tenor of its
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was glorious, the long, hot summer days melting into balmy
      nights when the hills and dales amid which the old house was set were
      bathed in moonlight mystery&mdash;transmuted into a wonderland of
      phantasy, cavernous with shadow where undreamed-of dragons lurked, lambent
      with opalescent fields of splendour whence uprose the glimmer of
      half-visioned palaces or the battlemented walls of some ethereal fairy
      castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once Jean&rsquo;s thoughts turned wistfully towards the Moor
      which she had so longed to see by moonlight&mdash;Judith&rsquo;s &ldquo;holy
      of holies that God must have made for His spirits&rdquo;&mdash;and she
      felt disposed to blame herself for the robust attack of caution which had
      impelled her to refuse the invitation to the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One loses half the best things in life by being afraid,&rdquo; she
      told herself petulantly. &ldquo;And a second chance to take them doesn&rsquo;t
      come!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt almost tempted to write to Judith and propose that she should
      join her at the bungalow for a few days after all if she still had room
      for her. And then, as is often the way of things just when we are
      contemplating taking the management of affairs into our own hands, the
      second chance offered itself without any directing impulse on Jean&rsquo;s
      part.
    </p>
    <p>
      The telephone bell rang, and Jean, who was expecting an answer to an
      important message she had &rsquo;phoned through on Lady Anne&rsquo;s
      behalf, hastened to answer it. Very much to her surprise she found that it
      was Burke who was speaking at the other end of the wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that you, Geoffrey?&rdquo; she exclaimed in astonishment.
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know your bungalow was on the telephone. I thought
      you were miles from anywhere!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t. And we are,&rdquo; came back Burke&rsquo;s voice.
      From a certain quality in it she knew that he was smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      in Okehampton, &rsquo;phoning from a pal&rsquo;s house. I&rsquo;ve a
      message for you from Judy.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye-es?&rdquo; intoned Jean enquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wants you to come up to-morrow, just for one night. It&rsquo;ll
      be a full moon and she says you have a hankering to see the Moor by
      moonlight. Have you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, oh yes!&rdquo;&mdash;with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought so. It certainly does look topping. Quite worth seeing.
      Well, look here, Judy&rsquo;s got a party of friends, down from town, who
      are coming over to us from the South Devon side&mdash;going to drive up
      and stay the night, and the idea is to do a moonlight scramble up on to
      the top of one of the tors after supper. Are you game?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! How heavenly!&rdquo; This, ecstatically, from Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavenly! <i>Heavenly!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;with increasing emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, &lsquo;heavenly&rsquo;&mdash;yes, I hear. Yes, it would be
      rather&mdash;if you came.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even through the&rsquo;phone Burke&rsquo;s voice conveyed something of
      that upsettingly fiery ardour of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come&mdash;unless you promise to behave,&rdquo; said
      Jean warningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bubbling over with pleasure at the prospect unfolded by the invitation,
      she found it a little difficult to infuse a befitting sternness into her
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I need to take fresh vows?&rdquo; came back Burke&rsquo;s
      answer, spoken rather gravely. &ldquo;I made you a promise that day&mdash;when
      we drove back from Dartmoor. I&rsquo;ll keep that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;ll never hiss you again till you give me your lips
      yourself.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words of the promise rushed vividly into Jean&rsquo;s mind, and now
      that steady voice through the &rsquo;phone, uttering its quiet endorsement
      of the assurance given, made her feel suddenly ashamed of her suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll come then,&rdquo; she said hastily. &ldquo;How
      shall I get to you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all planned, because we thought&mdash;at least we hoped&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      come. If you&rsquo;ll come down to Okehampton by the three o&rsquo;clock
      train from Coombe Eavie, I&rsquo;ll meet you there with the car and drive
      you up to the bungalow. Judy is going to drive into Newton Abbot early, to
      do some marketing, and afterwards she&rsquo;ll lunch with her London
      people&mdash;the Holfords. Then they&rsquo;ll all come up together in the
      afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Very well. I&rsquo;ll come to Okehampton by the three train
      to-morrow afternoon&rdquo;&mdash;repeating his instructions carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right. That&rsquo;s all fixed, then.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. <i>Mind</i> you also fix a fine day&mdash;or night, rather!
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmured farewell came back along the wire, and then Jean, replacing the
      receiver in its clip, ran off to apprise Lady Anne of the arrangements
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne looked up from some village charity accounts which were
      puckering her smooth brow to smile approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How nice, dear! Quite a charming plan&mdash;you&rsquo;ll enjoy it.
      Especially as there will be nothing to amuse you here to-morrow. I have
      two village committees to attend&mdash;I&rsquo;m in the chair, so I must
      go. And Blaise, I know, is booked for a busy day with the estate agent,
      while Nick is going down to South Devon somewhere for a day&rsquo;s
      fishing. I think he goes down to-night. Really, it&rsquo;s quite unusually
      lucky that Judith should have fixed on to-morrow for her moonlight party.&rdquo;

      warm with its subtle fragrance of gorse&mdash;like the scent of peaches
      when the sun is shining on them&mdash;tonic with the faint tang of salt
      borne by clean winds that had swept across the Atlantic, came to Jean&rsquo;s
      nostrils crisp and sparkling as a draught of golden wine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her, mile after mile, lay the white road&mdash;a sword of
      civilisation cleaving its way remorselessly across the green wilderness of
      mossy turf, and on either side rose the swelling hills and jagged peaks of
      the great tors, melting in the far distance into a vague, formless blur of
      purple that might be either cloud or tor as it merged at last into the dim
      haze of the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, blessed, blessed Moor!&rdquo; exclaimed Jean. &ldquo;How I love
      it! You know, half the people in the world haven&rsquo;t the least idea
      what Dartmoor is like. I was enthusing to a woman about it only the other
      day and she actually said, &lsquo;Oh, yes&mdash;Dartmoor. It&rsquo;s quite
      flat, I suppose, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; <i>Flat!</i>&rdquo; with sweeping
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke, his hand on the wheel of the big car which was eating up the miles
      with the facility of a boa-constrictor swallowing rabbits, smiled at the
      indignant little sniff with which the speech concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like dead levels, then?&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I like hills&mdash;something to look up to&mdash;to climb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spiritual as well as temporal?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I think I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled sardonically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that terrible angelic tendency of yours I complain
      of. It&rsquo;s too much for any mere material man to live up to. I wish
      you&rsquo;d step down to my low level occasionally. You don&rsquo;t seem
      to be afflicted with human passions like the rest of us&rdquo;&mdash;he
      added, a note of irritation in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean spoke impulsively, out of the depths of that inner, almost
      unconscious self-knowledge which lies within each one of us, dormant until
      some lance-like question pricks it into spontaneous affirmation. She had
      hardly heeded whither the conversation was tending, and she regretted her
      frank confession the instant it had left her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke turned and looked at her with a curious speculation in his glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s true?&rdquo; he said consideringly.
      &ldquo;If so, they&rsquo;re still asleep. I&rsquo;d give something to be
      the one to rouse them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the familiar, half-turbulent quality in his voice&mdash;the
      sound as of something held in leash. Jean sensed the danger in the
      atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll house one of them&mdash;the quite ordinary,
      commonplace one of bad temper, if you talk like that,&rdquo; she replied
      prosaically. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to play fair, Geoffrey&mdash;keep the
      spirit of the law as well as the letter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All&rsquo;s fair in love and war&mdash;as I told you before,&rdquo;
      he retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey&rdquo;&mdash;indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean!&rdquo;&mdash;mimicking her. &ldquo;Well, we won&rsquo;t
      quarrel about it now. Here we are at our journey&rsquo;s end. Behold the
      carriage drive!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The car swung round a sharp bend and then bumped its way up a roughly-made
      track which served to link a species of cobbled yard, constructed at one
      side of the bungalow, to the road along which they had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The track cleaved its way, rather on the principle of a railway cutting,
      clean through the abrupt acclivity which flanked the road that side, and
      rising steeply between crumbling, overhanging banks, fringed with coarse
      grass and tufted with straggling patches of gorse and heather, debouched
      on to a broad plateau. Here the road below was completely hidden from
      view; on all sides there stretched only a limitless vista of wild
      moorland, devoid of any sign of habitation save for the bare, creeperless
      walls of the bungalow itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the scene unfolded, Jean became suddenly conscious of a strange sense
      of familiarity. An inexplicable impress sion of having seen the place on
      some previous occasion, of familiarity with every detail of it&mdash;even
      to a recognition of its peculiar atmosphere of loneliness&mdash;took
      possession of her. For a moment she could not place the memory. Only she
      knew that it was associated in her mind with something disagreeable. Even
      now, as, at Burke&rsquo;s dictation, she waited in the car while he
      entered the bungalow from the back, passing through in order to admit his
      guest by way of the front door, which had been secured upon the inside,
      she was aware of a feeling of intense repugnance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, in a flash, recollection returned to her. This was the house of
      her dream&mdash;of the nightmare vision which had obsessed her during the
      hours of darkness following her first meeting with Geoffrey Burke.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood the solitary dwelling, set amid a wild and desolate country,
      and to one side of it grew three wretched-looking, scrubby little fir
      trees, all of them bent in the same direction by the keen winds as they
      came sweeping across the Moor from the wide Atlantic. Three Fir Bungalow!
      Why, the very name itself might have prewarned her!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fixed themselves on the green-painted door. She knew quite well
      what must happen next. The door would open and reveal Burke standing on
      the threshold. She watched it with fascinated eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently came the sound of steps, then the grating noise of a key turning
      stiffly in the lock. The door was flung open and Burke strode across the
      threshold and came to the side of the car to help her out. Jean waited,
      half terrified, for his first words. Would they be the words of her dream?
      She felt that if he chanced to say jokingly, &ldquo;Will you come into my
      parlour?&rdquo; she should scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go straight in, will you?&rdquo; said Burke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
      run the car round to the garage and then we might as well get tea ready
      before the others come. I&rsquo;m starving, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The spell was broken. The everyday, commonplace words brought with them a
      rush of overpowering relief, sweeping away the dreamlike sense of
      unreality and terror, and as Jean nodded and responded gaily, &ldquo;Absolutely
      famished!&rdquo; she could have laughed aloud at the ridiculous fears
      which had assailed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside of the bungalow was in charming contrast to its somewhat
      forbidding exterior. Its living-rooms, furnished very simply but with a
      shrewd eye to comfort, communicated one with the other by means of double
      doors which, usually left open, obviated the cramped feeling that the
      comparatively small size of the rooms might otherwise have produced, while
      the two lattice windows which each boasted were augmented by French
      windows opening out on to a verandah which ran the whole length of the
      building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, having delightedly explored the front portion of the bungalow,
      joined Burke in the kitchen, guided thither by the clinking of crockery
      and the cheerful crackle of a hearth fire wakened into fresh life by the
      scientific application of a pair of bellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea you were such a domesticated individual,&rdquo; she
      remarked, as she watched him carefully warming the brown earthenware
      teapot as a preliminary to brewing the tea while she busied herself making
      hot buttered toast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Judy and I are quite independent up here, I assure you,&rdquo;
      he answered with pardonable pride. &ldquo;We never bring any of the
      servants from Willow Ferry, but cook for ourselves. A woman comes over
      every morning to do the &lsquo;chores&rsquo;&mdash;clean the place, and
      wash up the dishes from the day before, and so on. But beyond that we are
      self-sufficing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does your woman come from? I didn&rsquo;t see a house for
      miles round.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t see the place, but there&rsquo;s a little
      farmstead, tucked away in a hollow about three miles from here, which
      provides us with cream and butter and eggs&mdash;-and with our char-lady.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean surveyed with satisfaction a rapidly mounting pile of delicately
      browned toast, creaming with golden butter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that&rsquo;s ready,&rdquo; she announced at last. &ldquo;I
      do hope Judy and Co. will arrive soon. Hot buttered toast spoils with
      keeping; it gets all sodden and tastes like underdone shoe leather. Do you
      think they&rsquo;ll be long?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke threw a glance at the grandfather&rsquo;s clock ticking solemnly
      away in a corner of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s half-past four,&rdquo; he said dubiously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      think we&rsquo;ll risk that luscious-looking toast of yours by waiting for
      them. I&rsquo;m going to brew the tea; the kettle&rsquo;s boiling.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t Judith think it rather horrid of us not to wait?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord, no! Judy and I never stand on any ceremony with each
      other. Any old thing might happen to delay them a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, frankly hungry after her spin in the car through the invigorating
      moorland air, yielded without further protest, and tea resolved itself
      into a jolly little <i>tête-à-tète</i> affair, partaken of in the shelter
      of the verandah, with the glorious vista of the Moor spread out before her
      delighted eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke was in one of those rare moods of his which never failed to inspire
      her with a genuine liking for him&mdash;when the unruly, turbulent devil
      within him, so hardly held in check, was temporarily replaced by a certain
      spontaneous boyishness of a distinctly endearing quality&mdash;that
      &ldquo;little boy&rdquo; quality which, in a grown man, always appeals so
      irresistibly to any woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time slipped away quickly, and it was with a shock of astonishment
      that Jean realised, on glancing down at the watch on her wrist, that over
      an hour and a half had gone by while they had been sitting chatting on the
      verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey! Do you know it&rsquo;s nearly six o&rsquo;clock! I&rsquo;m
      certain something must have happened. Judy and the Holfords would surely
      be here by now if they hadn&rsquo;t had an accident of some sort.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke looked at his own watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he acquiesced slowly. &ldquo;It is&mdash;getting late.&rdquo;
      A look of concern spread itself over Jean&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we ought to get the car out again and go and see if
      anything has happened,&rdquo; she said decisively. &ldquo;They may have
      had a spill. Were they coming by motor?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Judy drove down to Newton Abbot in the dog-cart, and the
      Holfords proposed hiring some sort of conveyance from a livery stable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I expect they&rsquo;ve had a smash of some kind. I&rsquo;m
      sure we ought to go and find out! Was Judy driving that excitable chestnut
      of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;a perfectly well-conducted pony, as meek as Moses. We&rsquo;ll
      give them a quarter of an hour more. If they don&rsquo;t turn up by then,
      I&rsquo;ll run the car out and we&rsquo;ll investigate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The minutes crawled by on leaden feet. Jean felt restless and uneasy and
      more than a trifle astonished that Burke should manifest so little anxiety
      concerning his sister&rsquo;s whereabouts. Then, just before the quarter
      of an hour was up, there came the shrill tinkle of a bicycle bell, and a
      boy cycled up to the gate and, springing off his machine, advanced up the
      cobbled path with a telegram in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s face blanched, and she waited in taut suspense while Burke
      ripped open the ominous orange-coloured envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked nervously. &ldquo;Have they&mdash;is
      it bad news?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before Burke answered. Then, he handed the flimsy sheet
      to her, remarking shortly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not coming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s eyes flew along the brief message.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;<i>Returning to-morrow. Am staying the night with Holfords.
     Judy</i>.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Her face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How horribly disappointing!&rdquo; Her glance fluttered,
      regretfully to the faint disc of the moon showing like a pallid ghost of
      itself in a sky still luminous with the afternoon sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t see my moonlit Moor to-night after all!&rdquo; she
      continued. &ldquo;I wonder what has happened to make them change their
      plans?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke volunteered no suggestion but stood staring moodily at the swiftly
      receding figure of the telegraph boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Jean braced herself to meet the disappointment,
      &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing for it but for you to run me back home,
      Geoffrey. We ought to start at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;ll go and get the car out,&rdquo; he answered.
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s the only thing to be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved off in the direction of the garage, Jean walking rather
      disconsolately beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>am</i> disappointed!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I just hate
      the sight of a telegraph boy! They always spoil things. I rather wonder
      you get your telegrams delivered at this outlandish spot,&rdquo; she added
      musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course we have to pay mileage. There&rsquo;s no free
      delivery to the &lsquo;back o&rsquo; beyond&rsquo;!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Burke vanished into the semi-dusk of the garage, and
      presently Jean heard sounds suggestive of ineffectual attempts to start
      the engine, accompanied by a muttered curse or two. A few minutes later
      Burke reappeared, looking Rather hot and dusty and with a black smear of
      oil across his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go back to the bungalow,&rdquo; he said gruffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something gone wrong with the works, and it will take
      me a few minutes to put matters right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded sympathetically and retreated towards the house, leaving him
      to tinker with the car&rsquo;s internals. It was growing chilly&mdash;the
      &ldquo;cool of the evening&rdquo; manifests itself early up on Dartmoor&mdash;and
      she was not at all sorry to find herself indoors. The wind had dropped,
      but a curious, still sort of coldness seemed to be permeating the
      atmosphere, faintly moist, and, as Jean stood at the window, gazing out
      half absently, she suddenly noticed a delicate blur of mist veiling the
      low-lying ground towards the right of the bungalow. Her eyes hurriedly
      swept the wide expanse in front of her. The valleys between the distant
      tors were hardly visible. They had become mere basins cupping wan lakes of
      wraithlike vapour which, even as she watched them, crept higher, inch by
      inch, as though responding to some impulse of a rising tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean had lived long enough in Devonshire by this time to know the risks of
      being caught in a mist on Dartmoor, and she sped out of the room,
      intending to go to the garage and warn Burke that he must hurry. He met
      her on the threshold of the bungalow, and she turned back with him into
      the room she had just quitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; she asked eagerly. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
      regular moor mist coming on. The sooner we start the better.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her oddly. He was rather pale and his eyes were curiously
      bright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The car won&rsquo;t budge,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      tinkering at her all this time to no purpose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at him, a vague apprehension of disagreeable possibilities
      presenting itself to her mind. Their predicament would be an extremely
      awkward one if the car remained recalcitrant!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t budge?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;But you must make it
      budge, Geoffrey. We can&rsquo;t&mdash;we can&rsquo;t <i>stay</i> here!
      What&rsquo;s gone wrong with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke launched out into a string of technicalities which left Jean with a
      confused feeling that the mechanism of a motor must be an invention of the
      devil designed expressly for the chastening of human nature, but from
      which she succeeded in gathering the bare skeleton fact that something had
      gone radically wrong with the car&rsquo;s running powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her apprehensions quickened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are we to do?&rdquo; she asked blankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the best of a bad job&mdash;and console each other,&rdquo; he
      suggested lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She frowned a little. It did not seem to her quite the moment for jesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, Geoffrey,&rdquo; she said sharply.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back <i>somehow</i>. What can you do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything more than I&rsquo;ve done. Here we are
      and here we&rsquo;ve got to stay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; she said, in a quick, low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with a sudden devil-may-care glint in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never can tell beforehand whether things are impossible or not.
      I know I used to think that heaven on earth was&mdash;impossible,&rdquo;
      he said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure now.&rdquo; He drew a step
      nearer her. &ldquo;Would you mind so dreadfully if we had to stay here,
      little Miss Prunes-and-Prisms?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at him in amazement&mdash;in amazement which slowly turned to
      incredulous horror as a sudden almost unbelievable idea flashed into her
      mind, kindled into being by the leaping, half-exultant note in his tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Her lips moved stiffly, even
      to herself, her voice sounded strange and hoarse. &ldquo;Geoffrey, I don&rsquo;t
      believe there is anything wrong with the car at all!... Or if there is,
      you&rsquo;ve tampered with it on purpose.... You&rsquo;re not being
      straight with me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off, her startled gaze searching his face as though she would
      wring the truth from him. Her eyes were very wide and dilated, but back of
      the anger that blazed in them lurked fear&mdash;stark fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Burke was silent. Then he spoke, with a quiet deliberateness
      that held something ominous, inexorable, in its very calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not
      been straight with you. But I&rsquo;ll be frank with you now. The whole
      thing&mdash;asking you to come here to-day, the moonlight expedition for
      to-night&mdash;everything&mdash;was all fixed up, planned solely to get
      you here. The car won&rsquo;t run for the simple reason that I&rsquo;ve
      put it out of action. I wasn&rsquo;t quite sure whether or no you could
      drive a car, you see!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Jean. Her voice was quite
      expressionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? So much the better, then. But I wasn&rsquo;t going to leave any
      weak link in the chain by which I hold you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By which you hold me?&rdquo; she repeated dully. She felt stunned,
      incapable of protest, only able to repeat, parrotlike, the words he had
      just used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you understand the position? It&rsquo;s clear
      enough, I should think!&rdquo; He laughed a little recklessly. &ldquo;Either
      you promise to marry me, in which case I&rsquo;ll take you home at once&mdash;the
      car&rsquo;s not damaged beyond repair&mdash;or you stay here, here at the
      bungalow with me, until tomorrow morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp cry she retreated from him, her face ash-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no! Not that!&rdquo; The poignancy of that caught-back cry
      wrenched the words from his lips in hurrying, vehement disclaimer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      be perfectly safe&mdash;as safe as though you were my sister. Don&rsquo;t
      look like that.... Jean! Jean! Could you imagine that I would hurt you&mdash;you
      when I worship&mdash;my little white love?&rdquo; The words rushed out in
      a torrent, hoarse and shaken and passionately tender. &ldquo;Before God,
      no! You&rsquo;ll be utterly safe, Jean, sweetest, beloved&mdash;I swear
      it!&rdquo; His voice steadied and deepened. &ldquo;Sacred as the purest
      love in the whole world could hold you.&rdquo; He was silent a moment;
      then, as the tension in her face gradually relaxed, he went on: &ldquo;But
      the world won&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; The note of tenderness was gone
      now, swept away by the resurgence of a fierce relentlessness&mdash;triumphant,
      implacable&mdash;that meant winning at all costs. &ldquo;The world won&rsquo;t
      know that,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;After tonight, for your own sake&mdash;because
      a woman&rsquo;s reputation cannot stand the breath of scandal, you&rsquo;ll
      be <i>compelled</i> to marry me. You&rsquo;ll have no choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stood quite still, staring in front of her. Once her lips moved, but
      no sound came from them. Slowly, laboriously almost, she was realising
      exactly what had happened, her mind adjusting itself to the recognition of
      the trap in which she had been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dream had come true, after all&mdash;horribly, inconceivably true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy silence which had fallen seemed suddenly filled with the
      dream-Burke&rsquo;s voice&mdash;mocking and exultant:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... you&rsquo;ll be stamped with the mark of the beast for ever. It&rsquo;s
      too late to try and run away.... It&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">&ldquo;T</span> HEN that
      telegram&mdash;that telegram from Judy&mdash;I suppose that was all part
      of the plan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt the futility of the question even while she asked it. The answer
      was so inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;briefly. &ldquo;I knew that Judy meant staying the
      night with her friends before she went away. She sent the wire&mdash;because
      I asked her to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Judy did that?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such an immeasurable anguish of reproach in the low,
      quick-spoken whisper that Burke felt glad Judith was not there to hear it.
      Had it been otherwise, she might have regretted the share she had taken in
      the proceedings, small as it had been. She was not a man, half-crazed by
      love, in whose passion-blurred vision nothing counted save the winning of
      the one woman, nor had she known Burke&rsquo;s plan in its entirety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Judy sent the wire,&rdquo; he said.. &ldquo;But give her so
      much credit, she didn&rsquo;t know that I intended&mdash;this. She only
      knew that I wanted another chance of seeing you alone&mdash;of asking you
      to be my wife, and I told her that you wouldn&rsquo;t come up to the
      bungalow unless you believed that she would be there too. I didn&rsquo;t
      think you&rsquo;d trust yourself alone with me again&mdash;after that
      afternoon at the inn&rdquo;&mdash;with blunt candour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I shouldn&rsquo;t have done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see I had to think of something&mdash;some way. And it was
      you yourself who suggested this method.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo;&mdash;incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don&rsquo;t you remember what you told me that day I drove you
      back from Dartmoor &lsquo;<i>A woman&rsquo;s happiness depends upon her
      reputation</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him quickly, recalling the scattered details of that
      afternoon&mdash;Burke&rsquo;s gibes at what he believed to be her fear of
      gossiping tongues and her own answer to his taunts: &ldquo;No woman can
      afford to ignore scandal.&rdquo; And then, following upon that, his
      sudden, curious absorption in his own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remembrance of it all was like a torchlight flashed into a dark place,
      illuminating what had been hidden and inscrutable. She spoke swiftly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was then&mdash;that afternoon&mdash;you thought of this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he acknowledged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent. It was all clear now&mdash;penetratingly so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Holfords? Are there any such people?&rdquo; she asked
      drearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely knew what prompted her to put so purposeless and unimportant
      a question. Actually, she felt no interest at all in the answer. It could
      not make the least difference to her present circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was a little the feeling that this trumpery process of question
      and answer served to postpone the inevitable moment when she must face the
      situation in which she found herself&mdash;face it in its simple
      crudeness, denuded of unessential whys and wherefores.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, the Holfords are quite real,&rdquo; answered Burke.
      &ldquo;And so is the plan for an expedition to one of the tors by
      moonlight. Only it will be carried out to-morrow night instead of
      to-night. To-night is for the settlement between you and me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The strained expression of utter, shocked incredulity was gradually
      leaving Jean&rsquo;s face. The unreal was becoming real, and she knew now
      what she was up against; the hard, reckless quality of Burke&rsquo;s voice
      left her no illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t really do
      this thing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If she had hoped to move him by a simple, straightforward appeal to the
      best that might be in him, she failed completely. For the moment, all that
      was good in him, anything chivalrous which the helplessness of her
      womanhood might have invoked, was in abeyance. He was mere primitive man,
      who had succeeded in carrying off the woman he meant to mate and was
      prepared to hold her at all costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I would compel you,&rdquo; he said doggedly. &ldquo;That
      I would let nothing in the world stand between you and me. And I meant
      every word I said. You&rsquo;ve no way out now&mdash;except marriage with
      me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The imperious decision of his tone roused her fighting spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you imagine,&rdquo; she broke out scornfully, &ldquo;that&mdash;after
      this&mdash;I would ever marry you?... I wouldn&rsquo;t marry you if you
      were the last man on earth! I&rsquo;d die sooner!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay you would,&rdquo; he returned composedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      too much grit to be afraid of death. Only, you see, that doesn&rsquo;t
      happen to be the alternative. The alternative is a smirched reputation.
      Tarnished a little&mdash;after to-night&mdash;even if you marry me;
      dragged utterly in the mire if you refuse. I&rsquo;m putting it before you
      with brutal frankness, I know. But I want you to realise just what it
      means and to promise that you&rsquo;ll be my wife before it&rsquo;s too
      late&mdash;while I can still get you back to Staple during the hours of
      propriety&rdquo;&mdash;smiling grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him with a slow, measured glance of bitter contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even a tarnished reputation might be preferable to marriage with
      you&mdash;more endurable,&rdquo; she added, with the sudden tormented
      impulse of a trapped thing to hurt back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t really believe that&rdquo;&mdash;impetuously&mdash;&ldquo;I
      know <i>I know</i> I could make you happy! You&rsquo;d be the one woman in
      the world to me. And I don&rsquo;t think&rdquo;&mdash;more quietly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      you could endure a slurred name, Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no answer. Every word he spoke only made it more saliently clear
      to her that she was caught&mdash;bound hand and foot in a web from which
      there was no escape. Yet, little as Burke guessed it, the actual question
      of &ldquo;what people might say&rdquo; did not trouble her to any great
      extent. She was too much her father&rsquo;s own daughter to permit a mere
      matter of reputation to force her into a distasteful marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that she minimised the value of good repute. She was perfectly aware
      that if she refused to marry Burke, and he carried out his threat of
      detaining her at the bungalow until the following morning, she would have
      a heavy penalty to pay&mdash;the utmost penalty which a suspicious world
      exacts from a woman, even though she may be essentially innocent, in whose
      past there lurks a questionable episode.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had courage enough to face the consequences of that refusal, to
      stand up to the clatter of poisonous tongues that must ensue; and trust
      enough to bank on the loyalty of her real friends, knowing it would be the
      same splendid loyalty that she herself would have given to any one of them
      in like circumstances. For Jean was a woman who won more than mere
      lip-service from those who called themselves her friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burke had never been more mistaken in his calculations than when he
      counted upon forcing her hand by the mere fear of scandal. But none the
      less he held her&mdash;and held her in the meshes of a far stronger and
      more binding net, had he but realised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back upon the episode from which her present predicament had
      actually sprung, Jean could almost have found it in her heart to smile at
      the relative importance which, at the time, that same incident had assumed
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had seemed to her, then, that for Blaise ever to hear that she had been
      locked in a room with Burke, had spent an uncounted, hour or so with him
      at the &ldquo;honeymooners&rsquo; inn&rdquo; would be the uttermost
      calamity that could befall her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would never believe that it had been by no will of hers&mdash;so she
      had thought at the time&mdash;and that fierce lover&rsquo;s jealousy which
      had been the origin of their quarrel, and of all the subsequent mutual
      misunderstandings and aloofness, would be roused to fresh life, and his
      distrust of her become something infinitely more difficult to combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But compared with the present situation which confronted her, the
      happenings of that past day faded into insignificance. She stood, now,
      face to face with a choice such as surely few women had been forced to
      make.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whichever way she decided, whichever of the two alternatives she accepted,
      her happiness must pay the price. Nothing she could ever say or do,
      afterwards, would set her right in the eyes of the man whose belief in her
      meant everything. Whether she agreed to marry Burke, returning home in the
      odour of sanctity within the next hour or two, or whether she refused and
      returned the next morning&mdash;free, but with the incontrovertible fact
      of a night spent at Burke&rsquo;s bungalow, alone with him, behind her,
      Blaise would never trust or believe in her love for him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if she promised to marry Burke and so save her reputation, it must
      automatically mean the end of everything between herself and the man she
      loved&mdash;the dropping of an iron curtain compared with which the wall
      built up out of their frequent misunderstandings in the past seemed
      something as trifling and as easily demolished as a card house.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if she risked her good name and kept her freedom, she
      would be equally as cut off from him. Not that she feared Blaise would
      take the blackest view of the affair&mdash;she was sure that he believed
      in her enough not to misjudge her as the world might do&mdash;but he would
      inevitably think that she had deliberately chosen to spend an afternoon on
      the Moor alone with Burke&mdash;&ldquo;playing with fire&rdquo; exactly as
      he had warned her not to, and getting her fingers burnt in consequence&mdash;and
      he would accept it as a sheer denial of the silent pledge of love
      understood which bound them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would never trust her again&mdash;nor forgive her. No man could. Love&rsquo;s
      loyalty, rocked by the swift currents of jealousy and passion, is not of
      the same quality as the steady loyalty of friendship&mdash;that calm,
      unshakable confidence which may exist between man and man or woman and
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover&mdash;and here alone was where the fear of gossip troubled her&mdash;even
      if the inconceivable happened and Blaise forgave and trusted her again,
      she could not go to him with a slurred name, give him herself&mdash;when
      the gift was outwardly tarnished. The Tormarin pride was unyielding as a
      rock&mdash;and Tormarin women had always been above suspicion. She could
      not break the tradition of an old name&mdash;do that disservice to the man
      she loved! No, if she could find no way out of the web in which she had
      been caught she was set as far apart from Blaise as though they had never
      met. Only the agony of meeting and remembrance would be with her for the
      rest of life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean envisaged very clearly the possibilities that lay ahead&mdash;envisaged
      them with a breathless, torturing perception of their imminence. It was to
      be a fight&mdash;here and now&mdash;for the whole happiness that life
      might hold.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Burke, breaking at last the long silence which had descended
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do you suppose I feel towards you, Geoffrey? Will you be
      content to have your wife think of you&mdash;as I must think?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint shadow flitted across his face. The quiet scorn of her words&mdash;their
      underlying significance&mdash;flicked him on the raw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be content to have you as my wife&mdash;at any price,&rdquo;
      he said stubbornly. &ldquo;Jean&rdquo;&mdash;a sudden urgency in his tones&mdash;&ldquo;try
      to believe I hate all this as much as you do. When you&rsquo;re my wife, I&rsquo;ll
      spend my life in teaching you to forget it&mdash;in&mdash;wiping the very
      memory of to-day out of your mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never forgot it,&rdquo; she said slowly. Then, bitterly:
      &ldquo;I wonder why you even offer me a choice&mdash;when you know; that
      it is really no choice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because I swore to you that you should give me what I want&mdash;that
      I wouldn&rsquo;t take even a kiss from you again by force. But&rdquo;&mdash;unevenly&mdash;&ldquo;I
      didn&rsquo;t know what it meant&mdash;the waiting!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, the mist had thickened into fog, curtaining the windows. The
      light had dimmed to a queer, glimmering dusk, changing the values of
      things, and out of the shifting shadows her white face, with its scarlet
      line of scornful mouth, gleamed at him&mdash;elusive, tantalising as a
      flower that sways out of reach. In the uncertain half-light which
      struggled in through the dulled window-panes there was something
      provocative, maddening&mdash;a kind of etherealised lure of the senses in
      the wavering, shadowed loveliness of her. The man&rsquo;s pulses leaped;
      something within him slipped its leash.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kiss me!&rdquo; he demanded hoarsely. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep me
      waiting any longer. Give me your lips... now... now...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang aside from him, warding him off. Her eyes stormed at him out of
      her white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You promised!&rdquo; she cried, her voice sharp with fear. &ldquo;You
      promised!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension of the next moment strained her nerves to breaking-point.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell back. Slowly his arms dropped to his sides without touching
      her, his hands clenching with the effort that it cost him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said, breathing quickly. &ldquo;I
      promised. I&rsquo;ll keep my promise.&rdquo; Then, vehemently: &ldquo;Jean,
      why won&rsquo;t you let me take you home? I could put the car right in ten
      minutes. Come home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was unmistakable appeal in his tones. It was obvious he hated the
      task to which he had set himself, although he had no intention of
      yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you? Will you take me home, Geoffrey?... Or&rdquo;&mdash;bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;is
      this only another trap?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you home&mdash;at once, <i>now</i>&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll
      promise to be my wife. Jean, it&rsquo;s better than waiting till to-morrow&mdash;till
      circumstances <i>force</i> you into it!&rdquo; he urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, thinking rapidly. That sudden break in Burke&rsquo;s
      control, when for a moment she had feared his promise would not hold him,
      had warned her to put an end to the scene&mdash;if only temporarily&mdash;as
      quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very trusting,&rdquo; she said, forcing herself to speak
      lightly. &ldquo;How do you know that I shall not give you the pledge you
      ask merely in order to get home&mdash;and then decline to keep it? I think&rdquo;&mdash;reflectively&mdash;&ldquo;I
      should be quite justified in the circumstances.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled a little and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of that. If
      you give me your word, I know you&rsquo;ll keep it. You wouldn&rsquo;t be&mdash;you&mdash;if
      you could do otherwise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, Jean was tempted, fiercely tempted to take his blind belief
      in her and use it to extricate herself from the position into which he had
      thrust her. As she herself had said, the circumstances were such as almost
      to justify her. Yet something within her, something that was an integral
      part of her whole nature, rebelled against the idea of giving a promise
      which, from the moment that she made it, she would have no smallest
      intention of keeping. It would be like the breaking of a prisoner&rsquo;s
      given parole&mdash;equally mean and dishonourable.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little mental shrug she dismissed the idea and the brief
      temptation. She must find some other way, some other road to safety. If
      only he would leave her alone, leave her just long enough for her to make
      a rush for it&mdash;out of the house into that wide wilderness of
      mist-wrapped moor!
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be a virtually hopeless task to find her way to any village or to
      the farmstead, three miles away, of which Burke had spoken. She knew that.
      Even moorwise folk not infrequently entirely lost their bearings in a
      Dartmoor mist, and, as far as she herself was concerned, she had not the
      remotest idea in which direction the nearest habitation lay. It would be a
      hazardous experiment&mdash;fraught with danger. But danger was preferable
      to the dreadful safety of the bungalow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a brief space, stung to swift decision by that tense moment when Burke&rsquo;s
      self-mastery had given way, she had made up her mind to risk the open
      moor. But, for that she must somehow contrive to be left alone. She must
      gain time&mdash;time to allay Burke&rsquo;s suspicions by pretending to
      make the best of the matter, and then, on some pretext or other, get him
      out of the room. It was the sole way of escape she could devise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, which is it to be?&rdquo; Burke&rsquo;s voice broke in
      harshly upon the wild turmoil of her thoughts. &ldquo;Your promise&mdash;and
      Staple within an hour and a half? Or&mdash;the other alternative?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it can be either&mdash;yet,&rdquo; she said
      quietly. &ldquo;What you&rsquo;re asking&mdash;it&rsquo;s too big a
      question for a woman to decide all in a minute. Don&rsquo;t you see&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a rather shaky little laugh&mdash;&ldquo;it means my whole life? I&mdash;I
      must have time, Geoffrey. I can&rsquo;t decide now. What time is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a match, holding the flame close to the dial of his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that?&rdquo; The words escaped her involuntarily. It seemed
      hours, an eternity, since she had read those few brief words contained in
      Judith&rsquo;s telegram. And it was barely an hour ago!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then I can have a little time to think it over,&rdquo;
      she said after a moment. &ldquo;We could get back to Staple by ten if we
      left here at eight-thirty?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There or thereabouts. We should have to go slow through this
      infernal mist Jean&rdquo;&mdash;his voice took on a note of passionate
      entreaty&mdash;&ldquo;sweetest, won&rsquo;t you give me your promise and
      let me take you home? You shall never regret it. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hush!&rdquo; she checked him quickly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      answer you now, Geoffrey. I must have time&mdash;time. Don&rsquo;t press
      me now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&rdquo; There was an unaccustomed gentleness in his
      manner. Perhaps something in the intense weariness of her tones appealed
      to him. &ldquo;Are you very tired, Jean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know&rdquo;&mdash;she spoke with some surprise, as though
      the idea had only just presented itself to her&mdash;&ldquo;do you know, I
      believe I&rsquo;m rather hungry! It sounds very material of me&rdquo;&mdash;laughing
      a little. &ldquo;A woman in my predicament ought to be quite above&mdash;or
      beyond&mdash;mere pangs of hunger.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hungry! By Jove, and well you might be by this hour of the day!&rdquo;
      he exclaimed remorsefully. &ldquo;Look here, we&rsquo;ll have supper.
      There are some chops in the larder. We&rsquo;ll cook them together&mdash;and
      then you&rsquo;ll see what a really domesticated husband I shall make.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a new gaiety, as though he felt very sure of her ultimate
      decision and glad that the strain of the struggle of opposing wills was
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chops! How heavenly! I&rsquo;m afraid&rdquo;&mdash;apologetically&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      very unromantic of me, Geoffrey!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed and, striking a match, lit the lamp. &ldquo;Disgustingly so!
      But there are moments for romance and moments for chops. And this is
      distinctly the moment for chops. Come along and help me cook &rsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He flashed a keen glance at her face as the sudden lamplight dispelled the
      shadows of the room. But there was nothing in it to contradict the
      insouciance of her speech. Her cheeks were a little flushed and her eyes
      very bright, but her smile was quite natural and unforced. Burke reflected
      that women were queer, unfathomable creatures. They would fight you to the
      last ditch&mdash;and then suddenly surrender, probably liking you in
      secret all the better for having mastered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten that he was dealing with a daughter of Jacqueline Mavory.
      All the actress that was Jean&rsquo;s mother came out in her now, called
      up from some hidden fount of inherited knowledge to meet the imperative
      need of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one, watching Jean as she accompanied Burke to the kitchen premises and
      assisted him in the preparation of their supper, would have imagined that
      she was acting her part in any other capacity than that of willing
      playmate. She was wise enough not to exhibit any desire to leave him alone
      during the process of carrying the requisites for the meal from the
      kitchen into the living-room. She had noticed the sudden mistrust in his
      watchful eyes and the way in which he had instantly followed her when, at
      the commencement of the proceedings, she had unthinkingly started off down
      the passage from the kitchen, carrying a small tray of table silver in her
      hand, and thereafter she refrained from giving him the slightest ground
      for suspicion. Together they cooked the chops, together laid the table,
      and finally sat down to share the appetising results of their united
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the little meal Jean preserved an attitude of detached
      friendliness, laughing at any small joke that cropped up in the course of
      conversation and responding gaily enough to Burke&rsquo;s efforts to
      entertain her. Now and again, as though unconsciously, she would fall into
      a brief reverie, apparently preoccupied with the choice that lay before
      her, and at these moments Burke would refrain from distracting her
      attention, but would watch intently, with those burning eyes of his, the
      charming face and sensitive mouth touched to a sudden new seriousness that
      appealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the meal had drawn to an end, his earlier suspicions had been
      lulled into tranquillity, and over the making of the coffee he became once
      more the big, overgrown schoolboy and jolly comrade of his less
      tempestuous moments. It almost seemed as though, to please her, to atone
      in a measure for the mental suffering he had thrust on her, he was
      endeavouring to keep the vehement lover in the background and show her
      only that side of himself which would serve to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather fancy myself at coffee-making,&rdquo; he told her, as he
      dexterously manipulated the little coffee machine. &ldquo;There!&rdquo;&mdash;pouring
      out two brimming cups&mdash;&ldquo;taste that, and then tell me if it isn&rsquo;t
      the best cup of coffee you ever met.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sipped it obediently, then made a wry face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ough!&rdquo; she ejaculated in disgust. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
      forgotten the sugar!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As she had herself slipped the sugar basin out of sight when he was
      collecting the necessary coffee paraphernalia on to a tray, the oversight
      was not surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a simple little ruse, its very simplicity it&rsquo;s passport to
      success. The naturalness of it&mdash;Jean&rsquo;s small, screwed-up face
      of disgust and the hasty way in which she set her cup down after tasting
      its contents&mdash;might have thrown the most suspicious of mortals
      momentarily off his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jove, so I have!&rdquo; Instinctively Burke sprang up to rectify
      the omission. &ldquo;I never take it myself, so I forgot all about it. I&rsquo;ll
      get you some in a second.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone, and before he was half-way down the passage leading to the
      kitchen, Jean, moving silently and swiftly as a shadow, was at the doors
      of the long French window, her fingers fumbling for the catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A draught of cold, mist-laden air rushed into the room, while a slender
      form stood poised for a brief instant on the threshold, silhouetted
      against the white curtain of the fog. Then followed a hurried rush of
      flying footsteps, a flitting shadow cleaving the thick pall of vapour, and
      a moment later the wreaths of pearly mist came filtering unhindered, into
      an empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Blindly Jean plunged through the dense mist that hung outside, her feet
      sinking into the sodden earth as she fled across the wet grass. She had no
      idea where the gate might be, but sped desperately onwards till she rushed
      full tilt into the bank of mud and stones which fenced the bungalow
      against the moor. The sudden impact nearly knocked all the breath out of
      her body, but she dared not pause. She trusted that his search for the
      hidden sugar basin might delay Burke long enough to give her a few minutes&rsquo;
      start, but she knew very well that he might chance upon it at any moment,
      and then, discovering her flight, come in pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clawing wildly at the bank with hands and feet, slipping, sliding, bruised
      by sharp-angled stones and pricked by some unseen bushy growth of gorse,
      she scrambled over the bank and came sliding down upon her hands and knees
      into the hedge-trough dug upon its further side. And even as she picked
      herself up, shaken and gasping for breath, she heard a cry from the
      bungalow, and then the sound of running steps and Burke&rsquo;s voice
      calling her by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean! Jean! You little fool!... Come back! Come back!&rdquo; She
      heard him pause to listen for her whereabouts. Then he shouted again.
      &ldquo;Come back! You&rsquo;ll kill yourself! Jean! Jean!....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she made no answer. Distraught by fear lest he should overtake her,
      she raced recklessly ahead into the fog, heedless of the fact that she
      could not see a yard in front of her&mdash;even glad of it, knowing that
      the mist hung like a shielding curtain betwixt her and her pursuer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange silence of the mist-laden atmosphere hemmed her round like the
      silence of a tomb, broken only by the sucking sound of the oozy turf as it
      pulled at her feet, clogging her steps. Lance-sharp spikes of gorse
      stabbed at her ankles as she trod it underfoot, and the permeating
      moisture in the air soaked swiftly through her thin summer frock till it
      clung about her like a winding-sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her breath was coming in sobbing gasps of stress and terror; her heart
      pounded in her breast; her limbs, impeded by her clinging skirts, felt as
      though they were weighted down with lead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, seeming close at hand in the misleading fog which plays
      odd tricks with sound as well as sight, she heard Burke&rsquo;s voice,
      cursing as he ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the instinct of a hunted thing she swerved sharply, stumbled, and
      lurched forward in a vain effort to regain her balance. Then it seemed as
      though the ground wore suddenly cut from under her feet, and she fell...
      down, down through the mist, with a scattering of crumbling earth and
      rubble, and lay, at last, a crumpled, unconscious heap in the deep-cut
      track that linked the moor road to the bungalow.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;THEY WHO WAITED
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ADY ANNE sat
      gazing absently into the heart of the fire, watching the restless leap of
      the flames and the little scattered handfuls of sparks, like golden star
      dust, tossed upward into the dark hollow of the chimney by the blazing
      logs. The &ldquo;warm and sunny south&rdquo;&mdash;at least, that part of
      it within a twelve-mile radius of Dartmoor&mdash;is quite capable, on
      occasion, of belying its guide-book designation, particularly towards the
      latter end of summer, and there was a raw dampness in the atmosphere this
      evening which made welcome company of a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed a little lonely without Jean&rsquo;s cheery presence, and Lady
      Anne, conscious of a craving for human companionship, glanced impatiently
      at the clock. Blaise should surely have returned by now from his all-day
      conference with the estate agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not much longer to wait. The quick hoof-beats of a trotting horse
      sounded on the drive outside, and a few minutes later the door of the room
      was thrown open and Blaise himself strode in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, madonna?&rdquo; He stooped and kissed her. &ldquo;Been a
      lonely lady to-day without all your children?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;When I came back
      from those stupid committees, which are merely an occasion for half the
      old tabbies in the village to indulge in a squabble with the other half, I
      couldn&rsquo;t help feeling it would have been nice to find Jean here to
      laugh over them with me. Jean&rsquo;s sense of humour is refreshing; it
      never lets one down. However, I suppose she&rsquo;s enjoying her beloved
      Moor by moonlight, so I mustn&rsquo;t grumble.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much moonlight they&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;I rode
      through a thick mist coming back from Hedge Barton. It&rsquo;ll he a
      blanket fog on Dartmoor to-night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, poor Jean! She&rsquo;ll he so disappointed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin sat down on the opposite side of the hearth and lit a cigarette.
      The dancing firelight flickered across his face. He was thinner of late,
      his mother thought with a quick pang. The lines of the well-beloved face
      had deepened; it had a worn&mdash;almost ascetic&mdash;look, like that of
      a man who is constantly contending against something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne looked across at him almost beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;have you quite made up your mind to
      let happiness pass you by?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, roused out of the reverie into which he had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve got any say in the matter,&rdquo; he
      replied quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forfeited my rights in that respect.
      You know that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jean? Are you going to make her forfeit her rights, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find happiness&mdash;somehow&mdash;elsewhere. It would
      be a very short-lived affair with me&rdquo;&mdash;bitterly. &ldquo;After
      what has happened, it&rsquo;s evident I&rsquo;m not to be trusted with a
      woman&rsquo;s happiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sounds of arrival in the hall. Nick&rsquo;s voice could be
      heard issuing instructions about the bestowal of his fishing tackle. Lady
      Anne spoke quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Blaise. Not with the happiness of the woman
      you love.&rdquo; She laid her hand on his shoulder as she passed him on
      her way into the hall to welcome the wanderer returned. &ldquo;Tell Jean,&rdquo;
      she advised, &ldquo;and see what she says. I think you&rsquo;ll find she&rsquo;d
      be willing to risk it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had left the room Blaise remained staring impassively into the
      fire. His expression gave no indication as to whether or not Lady Anne&rsquo;s
      advice had stirred him to any fresh impulse of decision, and when,
      presently, his mother and Nick entered the room together, he addressed the
      latter as casually as though no emotional depths had been stirred by the
      recent conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo, Nick! Had good sport?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only so-so. We had a jolly time, though&mdash;out at Het-worthy
      Bridge. But I had the deuce of a business getting back from Exeter this
      evening. It was so misty in places we could hardly see to drive the car.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I found the same. It&rsquo;s a surprising change in
      the weather.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Jean will have had a disappointing trip to Dartmoor,&rdquo;
      put in Lady Anne. &ldquo;The mist is certain to be bad up there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dartmoor? But she didn&rsquo;t go&mdash;surely?&rdquo; And Nick
      glanced from one to the other questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she did. It was quite clear in the afternoon when she
      started&mdash;looked like being a lovely night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick stammered and came to a halt. There was a look of bewilderment in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who&rsquo;s she gone with?&rdquo; he demanded at last. &ldquo;I
      thought she said she intended stopping the night with Judith and Burke at
      their bungalow?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she did,&rdquo; replied Blaise. &ldquo;Why? Have you any
      objection?&rdquo;&mdash;smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Only&rdquo;&mdash;Nick frowned&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite
      understand it Judith isn&rsquo;t <i>on</i> the Moor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on the Moor?&rdquo; broke simultaneously from Lady Anne and
      Blaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know, Nick?&rdquo; added the latter gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, because&rdquo;&mdash;Nick&rsquo;s face wore an expression of
      puzzled concern&mdash;&ldquo;because I saw Judith in Newton Abbot late
      this evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise leaned forward, a sudden look of concentration on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Judith?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What time?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been nearly eight o&rsquo;clock. I was buzzing along
      in Jim Cresswell&rsquo;s car to catch the seven forty-five up train, and I
      saw Judith with one of the Holfords&mdash;you know, those people from
      London&mdash;turning into the gateway of a house. I expect it was the
      place the Holfords are stopping at. They didn&rsquo;t see me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite certain? You&rsquo;ve made no mistake?&rdquo;
      said Blaise sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve made no mistake. Think I don&rsquo;t know Judy
      when I see her? But what&rsquo;s the meaning of it, Blaise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin rose to his feet, tossing the stump of his cigarette into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
      going to find out. Madonna&rdquo;&mdash;turning to his mother&mdash;&ldquo;did
      Jean tell you just exactly what Judith said when she rang her up on the&rsquo;phone
      about this moonlight plan?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Judith who rang up,&rdquo; replied Lady Anne, a
      faint misgiving showing itself in her face. &ldquo;It was Geoffrey who
      gave the message.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin looked at her with a sudden awakened expression in his eyes.
      There was dread in them, too&mdash;keen dread. The expression of a man
      who, all at once, sees the thing he values more than anything in the whole
      world being torn from him&mdash;dragged forcibly away from the shelter he
      could give into some unspeakable darkness of disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it.&rdquo; He pressed his finger against the bell-push
      and held it there, and when Baines came hurrying in response to the
      imperative summons, he said curtly: &ldquo;Order me a fresh horse round at
      once&mdash;<i>at once</i>, mind&mdash;tell Harding to saddle Orion, and to
      look sharp about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise&rdquo;&mdash;Lady Anne&rsquo;s obvious uneasiness had
      deepened to a sharp anxiety&mdash;&ldquo;Blaise, what are you going to do?
      What&mdash;what are you afraid of?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked her straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of just what you are afraid of, madonna&mdash;of
      the devil let loose in Geoffrey Burke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and you&rsquo;re going to look for her&mdash;for Jean?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find her,&rdquo; he corrected quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravity had set its seal on all three faces. Each was conscious of the
      same fear&mdash;the fear they could not put into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you take Orion?&rdquo; asked Nick. &ldquo;The little
      thoroughbred mare&mdash;Redwing&mdash;would do the journey quicker and he
      lighter of foot over any marshy ground on the Moor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Orion can go where he chooses,&rdquo; returned Tormarin. &ldquo;And
      he&rsquo;ll choose to-night. Redwing is a little bit of a thing, though
      she&rsquo;s game as a pebble. But she couldn&rsquo;t carry&mdash;two.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The significance of Tormarin&rsquo;s choice of his big roan hunter,
      three-parts thoroughbred and standing sixteen hands, came home to Nick. He
      nodded without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently he and Lady Anne accompanied Blaise into the hall. From the
      gravelled drive outside came the impatient stamping of Orion&rsquo;s
      iron-shod hoofs. Just at the last Lady Anne clung to her son&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bring her back, Blaise?&rdquo; she urged, a quiver in
      her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring her back, madonna,&rdquo; he answered quietly.
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later he and the great roan horse were lost to sight in the mirk
      of the night. Only the beat of galloping hoofs was flung back to the two
      who were left to watch and wait, muffled and vague through the shrouding
      mist like the sound of a distant drum.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;THE GOLDEN HOUR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>RION had fully
      justified Blaise&rsquo;s opinion of his capabilities. As though the great
      horse had gathered that there was trouble abroad to which he must not add,
      he had needed neither whip nor spur as he carried his master with long,
      sweeping strides over the miles that lay betwixt Staple and the Moor. He
      was as fresh as paint, and the rush through the cool night, under a rider
      with hands as light as a woman&rsquo;s and who sat him with a flexible
      ease, akin to that of a Cossack, had not distressed him in the very least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they were climbing the last long slope of the white road that
      approached the bungalow, the reins lying loosely on Orion&rsquo;s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mist had lifted a little in places, and a watery-looking moon peered
      through the clouds now and again, throwing a vague, uncertain light over
      the blurred and sombre moorland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin had no very definite plan of campaign in his mind. He felt
      convinced that he should find Jean at the bungalow. If, contrary to his
      expectation, she were not there, nor anyone else to whom he could apply
      for information as to her whereabouts, he would have to consider what his
      next move must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, his thoughts were preoccupied with the main fact that she had
      failed to return home. If she had accepted Burke&rsquo;s invitation to the
      bungalow, believing that Judith and the Holfords would be of the party,
      how was it that she had not at once returned when she discovered that for
      some reason they were not there?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weeks ago&mdash;during the period when she was defiantly
      investigating the possibilities of an &ldquo;unexploded bomb&rdquo;&mdash;it
      was quite possible that the queer recklessness which sometimes tempts a
      woman to experiment in order to see just how far she may go&mdash;the
      mysterious delight that the feminine temperament appears to derive from
      dancing on the edge of a precipice&mdash;might have induced her to remain
      and have tea with Burke, chaperon or no chaperon. And then it was quite on
      the cards that Burke&rsquo;s lawless disregard of anything in the world
      except the fulfilment of his own desires might have engineered the rest,
      and he might have detained her at the bungalow against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Blaise could not believe that a <i>tête-à-tête</i> tea with Burke
      would hold any attraction for Jean now&mdash;not since that day, just
      before the visit to London, when he and she had been discussing the
      affairs of Nick and Claire and had found, quite suddenly, that their own
      hearts were open to each other and that with the spoken word, &ldquo;Beloved,&rdquo;
      the misunderstandings of the past had faded away, to be replaced by a
      wordless trust and belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if it <i>had</i> attracted her, if&mdash;knowing precisely how much
      the man she loved would condemn&mdash;she had still deliberately chosen to
      spend an afternoon with Burke, why, then, Blaise realised with a swift
      pang that she was no longer his Jean at all but some other, lesser woman.
      Never again the &ldquo;little comrade&rdquo; whose crystalline honesty of
      soul and sensitive response to all that was sweet and wholesome and true
      had come into his scarred life to jewel its arid places with a new
      blossoming of the rose of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to thrust the thought away from him. It was just the kind of
      thing that Nesta would have done, playing off one man against the other
      with the innate instinct of the born coquette. But not Jean&mdash;not Jean
      of the candid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, through the thinning mist, Tormarin discerned the sharp turn of
      the track which branched off from the road towards the bungalow, and
      quickening Orion&rsquo;s pace, he was soon riding up the steep ascent, the
      moonlight throwing strange, confusing lights and shadows on the mist-wet
      surface of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, without the slightest warning, the roan snorted and wheeled
      around, shying violently away from the off-side bank. A less good horseman
      might have been unseated, but as the big horse swerved Tormarin&rsquo;s
      knees gripped against the saddle like a vice, and with a steadying word he
      faced him up the track again, then glanced keenly at the overhanging side
      of the roadway to discover what had frightened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later he had jerked Orion to a sudden standstill, leapt to the
      ground and, with the reins over his arm, crossed the road swiftly to
      where, clad in some light-stuff that glimmered strangely in the moonlight,
      lay a slender figure, propped against the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise!&rdquo; Jean&rsquo;s voice came weakly to his ears, but with
      a glad note in it of immense relief that bore witness to some previous
      strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant Tormarin was kneeling beside her, one arm behind her
      shoulders. He helped her to her feet and she leaned against him,
      shivering. Feeling in his pockets, he produced a brandy flask and held it
      to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink some of that!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to tell
      me anything yet.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The raw spirit sent the chilled blood racing through her veins, putting
      new life into her. A faint tinge of colour crept into her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Blaise! I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come&mdash;so glad!&rdquo;
      she said shakily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he returned grimly. &ldquo;See, drink a little more
      brandy. Then you shall tell me all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, bit by bit, she managed to give him a somewhat disjointed account
      of what had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must have been stunned for a little when I fell,&rdquo;
      she said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember anything after stepping right off
      into space, it seemed, till&mdash;oh, ages afterwards&mdash;- I found
      myself lying here. And when I tried to stand, I found I&rsquo;d hurt my
      ankle and that I couldn&rsquo;t put my foot to the ground. So&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a weak little attempt at laughter&mdash;&ldquo;I&mdash;I just sat down
      again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise gave vent to a quick exclamation of concern. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s
      nothing, really,&rdquo; she reassured him hastily. &ldquo;Only a strain.
      But I can&rsquo;t walk on it.&rdquo; Then, suddenly clinging to him with a
      nervous dread: &ldquo;Oh, take me away, Blaise&mdash;take me home!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. Don&rsquo;t be frightened&mdash;there&rsquo;s no need to be
      frightened any more, my Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know. I&rsquo;m not afraid&mdash;now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could hear the sob of utter nerve stress and exhaustion back of the
      brave words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take you home at once,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
      &ldquo;But, look here, you&rsquo;ve no coat on and you&rsquo;re wet with
      mist.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. My coat&rsquo;s at the bungalow. I left in a hurry, you see&rdquo;&mdash;whimsically.
      The irrepressible Peterson element, game to the core, was reasserting
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we must fetch it&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; Her voice rose in hasty protest. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t go back!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;don&rsquo;t! Geoffrey might be there&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better&rdquo;&mdash;grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like five
      minutes with him.&rdquo; Tormarin&rsquo;s hand tightened fiercely on the
      hunting-crop he carried. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s more likely lost his way in
      the mist and fetched up far enough away. Probably&rdquo;&mdash;with a
      short laugh&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;s still searching Dartmoor for! you. You&rsquo;d
      be on his mind a bit, you know! Wait here a minute while I ride up to the
      bungalow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she clung to his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! Don&rsquo;t go! I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t be left alone&mdash;again.&rdquo;
      The fear was coming back to her voice and Blaise, detecting it, abandoned
      the idea at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, little Jean,&rdquo; he said reassuringly. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
      leave you. Put my coat round you&rdquo;&mdash;stripping it off. &ldquo;There&mdash;like
      that.&rdquo; He helped her into it and fastened it with deft fingers.
      &ldquo;And now I&rsquo;m going to get you up on to Orion and we&rsquo;ll
      go home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never get up there,&rdquo; she observed, with a glance at
      the roan&rsquo;s great shoulders looming through the mist. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t
      be able to spring&mdash;I can only stand on one foot, remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise laughed cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. Just remain quite still&mdash;standing on your
      one foot, you poor little lame duck!&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his arm release its clasp of her, and a moment later he had swung
      his leg across the horse and was back in the saddle again. With a word to
      the big beast he dropped the reins on to his neck and, turning towards
      Jean, where she stood like a slim, pale ghost in the moonlight, he leaned
      down to her from the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you manage to come a step nearer?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hobbled forward painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lower, lower still he stooped, his arms outheld, and at last she felt them
      close round her, lifting her with that same strength of steel which she
      remembered on the mountain-side at Montavan. Orion stood like a statue&mdash;motionless
      as if he knew and understood all about it, his head slewed round a bit as
      though watching until the little business should be satisfactorily
      accomplished, and blowing gently through his velvety nostrils meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Jean found herself resting against the curve of Blaise&rsquo;s
      arm, with the roan&rsquo;s powerful shoulders, firm and solid as a rock,
      beneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right?&rdquo; queried Blaise, gathering up the reins in his
      left hand. &ldquo;Lean well back against my shoulder. There, how&rsquo;s
      that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an arm-chair.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you won&rsquo;t say the same by the end of the journey,&rdquo;
      he commented ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the end of the journey Jean was fast asleep. She had &ldquo;leant
      well back&rdquo; as directed, conscious, as she felt the firm clasp of
      Blaise&rsquo;s arm, of a supreme sense of security and well-being. The
      reaction from the strain of the afternoon, the exhaustion consequent upon
      her flight through the mist and the fall which had so suddenly ended it,
      and the rhythmic beat of Orion&rsquo;s hoofs all combined to lull her into
      a state of delicious drowsiness. It was so good to feel that she need
      fight and scheme and plan no longer, to feel utterly safe... to know that
      Blaise was holding her...
    </p>
    <p>
      Her head fell back against his shoulder, her eyes closed, and the next
      thing of which she was conscious was of being lifted down by a pair of
      strong arms and of a confused murmur of voices from amongst which she
      hazily distinguished Lady Anne&rsquo;s heartfelt: &ldquo;Thank God you&rsquo;ve
      found her!&rdquo; And then, characteristically practical, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
      have her in bed in five minutes. Blankets and hot-water bottles are all in
      readiness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the evening of the following day. Jean, tucked up on a couch and
      with her strained ankle comfortably bandaged, had been reluctantly
      furnishing Blaise with the particulars of her experience at the bungalow.
      She had been very unwilling to confide the whole story to him, fearing the
      consequences of the Tormarin temper as applied to Burke. A violent quarrel
      between the two men could do no good, she reflected, and would only be
      fraught with unpleasant results to all concerned&mdash;probably, in the
      end, securing a painful publicity for the whole affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately Blaise had been out when Judith had rung up earlier in the day
      to inquire if Jean had returned to Staple, or he might have fired off a
      few candid expressions of opinion through the telephone. But now there was
      no evading his searching questions, and he had quietly but determinedly
      insisted upon hearing the entire story. Once or twice an ejaculation of
      intense anger broke from him as he listened, but, beyond that, he made
      little comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And&mdash;and that was all,&rdquo; wound up Jean. &ldquo;And,
      anyway, Blaise&rdquo;&mdash;a little anxiously&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s
      over now, and I&rsquo;m none the worse except for the acquisition of a
      little more worldly wisdom and a strained ankle.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s over now,&rdquo; he said, standing looking down at
      her with a curious gleam in his eyes. &ldquo;But that sort of thing shan&rsquo;t
      happen twice. You&rsquo;ll have to marry me&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo;&mdash;imperiously.
      &ldquo;You shall never run such a risk again. We&rsquo;ll get married at
      once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jean, with a quiver of amusement at the corners of her mouth,
      responded meekly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute his arms were round her and their lips met in the first
      supreme kiss of love at last acknowledged&mdash;of love given and
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no gauge by which those first moments when two who love confess
      that they are lovers may be measured. It is the golden, timeless span when
      &ldquo;unborn to-morrow and dead yesterday&rdquo; cease to hem us round
      about and only love, and love&rsquo;s ecstasy, remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Blaise and Jean it might have been an hour&mdash;a commonplace period
      ticked off by the little silver clock upon the chimneypiece&mdash;or half
      eternity before they came back to the recollection of things mundane. When
      they did, it was across the kindly bridge of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise laughed out suddenly and boyishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s preposterous!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I quite forgot
      to propose.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did! Suppose&rdquo;&mdash;smiling up at him impertinently&mdash;&ldquo;suppose
      you do it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I! I won&rsquo;t waste my breath when I might put it to so much
      better use in calling you belovedest.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean was silent, but her eyes answered him. She had made room for him
      beside her, and now he was seated upon the edge of the Chesterfield,
      holding her in his arms. She did not want to talk much. That still, serene
      happiness which lies deep within the heart is not provocative of
      garrulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a question&mdash;the question that had tormented her through all
      the long months since she had first realised whither love was leading her,
      found its way to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before, Blaise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because of all that had happened in the past. You know&mdash;you
      have been told about Nesta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes! Don&rsquo;t talk about it, Blaise,&rdquo; she broke in
      hastily, sensing his distasteful recoil from the topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we must a little, dear,&rdquo; he responded gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Nesta was not all to blame&mdash;nor even very much, as I&rsquo;m
      sure&rdquo;&mdash;with a little half-tender smile&mdash;&ldquo;my mother
      tried hard to make you believe.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did. And I expect she was perfectly right&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;The fault was really mine. My
      initial mistake was in confusing the false fire with the true. It&mdash;was
      not love I had for Nesta. And I found it out when it was too late. We were
      poles apart in everything, and instead of trying to make it easier for
      her, trying to understand her and to lead her into our ways of looking at
      things. I only stormed at her. It roused all that was worst in me to see
      her trailing our name in the dust, throwing her dignity to the winds,
      craving for nothing other than amusement and excitement. I&rsquo;m not
      trying to excuse myself. There <i>was</i> no excuse for me. In my way, I
      was as culpable and foolish as she. And when the crash came&mdash;when I
      found her deliberately entertaining in my house, against my express
      orders, a man who ought to have been kicked out of any decent society,
      why, I let go. The Tormarin temper had its way with me. I shall never
      forgive myself for that. I frightened her, terrified her. I think I must
      have been half mad. And then&mdash;well, you know what followed. She
      rushed away and, before anyone could find her or help her, she had killed
      herself&mdash;thrown herself into the Seine. Quite what happened between
      leaving here and her death we were never able to find out. Apparently
      since her marriage with me, her sister had gone to Paris, unknown to her,
      and had taken a situation as <i>dame de compagnie</i> to some Frenchwoman,
      and Nesta, though she followed from Italy to Paris, failed to find her
      there. At least that is what Margherita Valdi told me in the letter
      announcing Nesta&rsquo;s death. Then she must have lost heart. So you see,
      morally I am responsible for that poor, reckless child&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, Blaise! I don&rsquo;t see that&rdquo;&mdash;pitifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? I do&mdash;very clearly. And that was why, when I
      found myself growing to care for you, I tried to keep away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket and produced a plain gold wedding ring. On the
      inside were engraved the initials &ldquo;B.T. and N.E.,&rdquo; and a date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my talisman. Alargherita sent it back to me when she wrote
      telling me of Nesta&rsquo;s death. Whenever I felt my resolution
      weakening, I used to take it out and have a look at it. It was always
      quite effective in thrusting me back into my proper place in the scheme of
      things&mdash;that is, outside any other woman&rsquo;s life.&rdquo; There
      was an inexpressible bitterness in his tones, and Jean drew a little
      nearer to him, her heart overflowing with compassion. He looked down at
      her, and smiled a thought ironically. &ldquo;But now&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      beaten me.&rdquo; His lips brushed her hair. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to be
      beaten, belovedest... I knew, that day at Montavan, what you might come to
      mean to me. And I intended never to see you again, but just to take that
      one day for remembrance. I felt that, having made such an utter hash of
      things, having spoiled one woman&rsquo;s life and been, indirectly, the
      cause of her death, I was not fit to hold another woman&rsquo;s happiness
      in my hands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rubbed her cheek against his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you thought better of it? she observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, even now, that I&rsquo;m right in letting you
      love me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stop me,&rdquo; she objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would if I could&mdash;now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean leaned up and, with a slender, dictatorial finger on the side of his
      face, turned his head towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Quite</i> sure?&rdquo; she demanded saucily. Then, without
      waiting for his answer: &ldquo;Blaise, I do love your chin&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      such a nice, square, your-money-or-your-life sort of chin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something light as a butterfly, warm as a woman&rsquo;s lips, just brushed
      the feature in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her into his arms, folding them closely about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&mdash;I love every bit of you,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
      &ldquo;Body and soul, I love you! Oh! Heart&rsquo;s beloved! Nothing&mdash;no
      one in the whole world shall come between us two ever again!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXX&mdash;THE GATEWAY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>UGUST seemed
      determined to justify her claim to be numbered amongst the summer months
      before making her exit. Apparently she had repented her of having recently
      veiled the country in a mist that might have been regarded as a very
      creditable effort even on the part of November, for to-day the sun was
      blazing down out of a cloudless sky and scarcely a breath of wind swayed
      the nodding cornstalks, heavy with golden grain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, her strained ankle now practically recovered, was tramping along the
      narrow footpath through the cornfield, following in Blaise&rsquo;s
      footsteps, while Nick brought up the rear of the procession. She had not
      seen Claire since her engagement had become an actual fact, though a
      characteristically warm-hearted little note from the latter had found its
      way to Staple, and this morning Jean had declared her inability to exist
      another day &ldquo;without a &lsquo;heart-to-heart&rsquo; talk with
      Claire.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence the afternoon&rsquo;s pilgrimage across the cornfield which formed
      part of a short cut between Staple and Charnwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Jean had feared lest her new-found happiness might raise a
      barrier of sorts betwixt herself and Claire. The contrast between the
      respective hands that fate had dealt them was so glaring, and the rose and
      gold with which love had suddenly decked Jean&rsquo;s own life seemed to
      make the bleak tragedy which enveloped Claire&rsquo;s appear ever darker
      than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Claire&rsquo;s letter, full of a quiet, unselfish rejoicing in the
      happiness which had fallen to the lot of her friend, had somehow smoothed
      away the little uncomfortable feeling which, to anyone as sensitive as
      Jean, had been a very real embarrassment. Nick&rsquo;s felicitations, too,
      had been tendered with frank cordiality and affection, and with a delicate
      perception that had successfully concealed the sting of individual pain
      which the contrast could hardly fail to have induced.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that it was with a considerably lightened heart that Jean, with her
      escort of two, passed between the great gates of Charnwood and, avoiding
      the lengthy walk entailed by following the windings of the drive, struck
      off across the velvety lawns&mdash;smooth stretches of close-cropped sward
      which, broken only by branching trees and shrubbery, and undefaced by the
      dreadful formality of symmetrical flower-beds, swept right up to the
      gravelled terrace fronting the windows of the house itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men loitered to discuss the points of a couple of young spaniels
      rollicking together on the grass, but Jean, eager to see Claire, smilingly
      declined to wait for them, and, speeding on ahead, she mounted the short
      flight of steps leading to the terrace from the lower level of the lawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Facing her, as she reached the topmost step was a glass door, giving
      entrance to Claire&rsquo;s own particular sanctum, which usually, in
      summer, stood wide open to admit the soft, warm air and the fragrant
      scents breathed out from a border of old-fashioned flowers, sweet and prim
      and quaint, which encircled the base of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-day the door was shut and forbidding-looking, and Jean experienced
      a sudden sense of misgiving. Supposing Claire chanced to be out just when
      she had arrived brimming over with the hundred little feminine confidences
      that were to have formed part of the &ldquo;heart-to-heart&rdquo; talk! It
      would be too aggravating!
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eager glance flew ahead, searching the room&rsquo;s interior, clearly
      visible through the wide glass panel of the door. Then, with a startled
      cry, she halted, her hand clapped against her lips to stifle the
      involuntary exclamation of dismay and terror that had leapt to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon sunshine slanted in upon a picture of grotesque horror&mdash;-a
      nightmare conception that could only have sprung from the macabre
      imagination of a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the room Claire sat bound to a high-backed chair, secured
      by cords which cut cruelly across her slender body. Her face had assumed a
      curious ashen shade, and her eyes were fixed in a numbed look of
      fascinated terror upon the tall, angular figure of her husband, which
      pranced in front of her jerkily, like a marionette, while he threatened
      her with a revolver, his thin lips, smiling cruelly, drawn back from his
      teeth like those of a snarling animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was addressing her in queer, high-pitched tones that had something
      inhuman about them&mdash;the echoing, empty sound of a voice no longer controlled
      by a reasoning brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t worry that Mr. Brennan will be overwhelmed
      with grief at your early demise. He won&rsquo;t&mdash;te-he-he!&rdquo;&mdash;he
      gave a foolish, cackling laugh&mdash;&ldquo;he won&rsquo;t have time to
      miss you much! I&rsquo;ll attend to that&mdash;I&rsquo;ll attend to that!
      There&rsquo;ll be a second bullet for your dear friend, Mr. Brennan.&rdquo;
      ... Crack! The sharp report of a revolver shattered the summer silence as
      Jean sprang forward and wrenched at the handle of the door. But it refused
      to yield. It had been locked upon the inside!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the smoke cleared away, she saw that Claire was Unhurt. Sir
      Adrian had deliberately fired above her head and was now rocking his long,
      lean body to and fro in a paroxysm of horrible, noiseless mirth. Evidently
      he purposed to amuse himself by inflicting the torture of suspense upon
      his victim before he actually murdered her, for Latimer had been at one
      time an expert revolver shot, and, even drug-ridden as he had since
      become, he could not well have missed his helpless target by accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s head had fallen back, but no merciful oblivion of
      unconsciousness had come to her relief. Her mouth was a little open and
      the breath came in short, quick gasps between her grey lips. Her face
      looked like a mask, set in a blank stupor of horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the shot brought Blaise and Nick racing to Jean&rsquo;s side.
      One glance through the glass door sufficed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven! He&rsquo;s gone mad!&rdquo; Nick&rsquo;s voice was
      quick with fear for the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get Tucker here at once!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise&rsquo;s swift command, flung at her as he and Nick leaped forward,
      sent Jean flying along the terrace as fast as feet winged with unutterable
      terror could carry her. As she ran, she heard the crash of splintering
      glass as the two men she had left behind smashed in the panel of the
      locked door, and, almost simultaneously, Sir Adrian&rsquo;s pistol barked
      again&mdash;another shot, and then a third in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound seemed to wring every nerve in her body... had that madman shot
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      With sobbing breath she rushed blindly on into the house and met the
      butler, running too, white faced and horror-stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God, miss! Sir Adrian&rsquo;s murdering her ladyship&mdash;and
      the room door&rsquo;s locked!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man almost babbled out the words in his extremity of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The terrace door... Quick, Tucker!&rdquo;&mdash;Jean gasped out the
      order. &ldquo;Mr. Brennan&rsquo;s there they&rsquo;ve broken in the
      glass...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Not waiting to hear the end of the sentence, Tucker bolted out of the hall
      and along the terrace, while Jean leaned up against the doorway drawing
      long, shuddering breaths that seemed actually to tear their way through
      her throat and yet brought no relief to the agonised thudding of her
      heart. For the moment she was physically unable to run another yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her mind was working with abnormal clarity and swiftness. This was her
      doing&mdash;hers! If she had not dissuaded Nick that day when he had
      proposed taking Claire away with him, all this would never have
      happened.... Claire would have been safe&mdash;safe! But she had
      interfered, clinging to her belief that no real good ever came by doing
      wrong, and now her creed had failed her utterly. Nick&rsquo;s resistance
      of temptation was culminating in a ghastly tragedy that might have been
      avoided. To Jean it seemed in that moment as if her world were falling in
      ruins about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sick with apprehension, she almost reeled out again into the mocking
      summer sunlight, and, running as fast as the convulsive throbbing of her
      heart would let her, regained the far end of the terrace and peered
      through the door that led into Claire&rsquo;s room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its great panes were shattered. Jagged teeth and spites of glass stuck out
      from the wooden framework, while here and there, dependent from them, were
      bits of cloth tom from the men&rsquo;s coats as they had scrambled
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the room Jean could discern a confused hurly-burly of swaying,
      writhing figures&mdash;Blaise and Nick and the butler struggling to
      overpower Sir Adrian, who was fighting them with all the cunning and the
      amazing strength of madness. From beyond came the clamour of people
      battering uselessly at the door, the shrill, excited voices of the
      frightened servants who had collected in the hall outside the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few breathless seconds Jean was in doubt&mdash;wondered wildly
      whether Sir Adrian would succeed in breaking away from his captors. Then
      she saw Nick&rsquo;s foot shoot out suddenly like the piston-rod of an
      engine, and Sir Adrian staggered and came crashing down on to his knees.
      The other two closed in upon him swiftly, and a minute later he was lying
      prone on his back with the three men holding him down by main force.
    </p>
    <p>
      With difficulty avoiding the protruding pieces of glass, Jean stepped into
      the room. Her first thought was for Claire, who now hung helpless and
      unconscious against the bonds that held her. But Blaise very speedily
      directed her attention to something of more urgent importance for the
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unlock that door,&rdquo; he called to her. &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; He
      was still panting from the exertion of the recent struggle. &ldquo;Get a
      rope of some sort!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean turned the key and tore open the door leading into the hall. The
      little flock of servants gathered outside it overflowed into the room,
      frightened and excitedly inquisitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some cord, one of you,&rdquo; commanded Jean authoratively.
      &ldquo;Anything will do if it&rsquo;s strong.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Two or three of the servants broke away from the main body and ran
      frantically in search of the required cord, glad to be of use, and very
      soon Sir Adrian, bound as humanely as his struggles rendered possible, was
      borne to his own room and laid upon his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring up the doctor,&rdquo; ordered Blaise, as he assisted in the
      rather difficult process of conveying Sir Adrian upstairs. &ldquo;Tell him
      to come to Charnwood as quickly as he can get here.&rdquo; And another
      eager little detachment of domestics flew off to carry out his bidding.
      The under-footman won the race for the telephone by a good half-yard, and,
      in a voice which fairly twittered with the agitating and amazing news he
      had to impart, transmitted the message to the doctor&rsquo;s parlour-maid
      at the other end of the wire, adding a few picturesque and stimulating
      details concerning the struggle which had just taken place&mdash;and
      which, apparently, he had perceived with the eye of faith through the
      wooden panels of the locked door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Nick and Jean had turned their attention towards releasing
      Claire, who, as the last of her bonds was cut, toppled forward in a dead
      faint into the former&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second procession wended its way upstairs, Nick bearing the slight,
      unconscious figure in his arms while Jean and a kindly-faced housemaid
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her ladyship&rsquo;s maid is out, miss,&rdquo; volunteered the
      girl. &ldquo;But perhaps I can help?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled at her, the frank, friendly smile that always won for her the
      eager, willing service of man and maid alike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you can,&rdquo; she said gently. &ldquo;As soon as
      we can bring her ladyship round, you shall help me undress her and put her
      to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Claire recovered consciousness, but she was horribly
      shaken and distraught, crying and clinging to Jean or to the housemaid&mdash;who
      was almost crying, too, out of sympathy&mdash;like a child frightened by
      the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, understanding just what was needed, shepherded Nick to the door of
      the room, where he lingered unhappily, his anxious gaze still fixed on the
      slender, shrinking figure upon the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Nick,&rdquo; she said reassuringly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll
      he all right; it&rsquo;s only reaction. But I know what she wants&mdash;she
      wants a real mother-person. Go down and ring up Lady Anne, will you, and
      ask her to come over in the car as quickly as she can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick nodded; the idea commended itself to him. His &ldquo;pale golden
      narcissus,&rdquo; so nearly broken, would be safe indeed with the kind,
      comforting arms of his mother about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an intense relief to Jean when Lady Anne arrived and quietly and
      efficiently took command of affairs. And there was sore need for her
      unruffled poise and capability throughout the night that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire, nervous and utterly unstrung, slept but little, waking constantly
      with a cry of terror as in imagination she relived the ordeal of the
      afternoon, while in the big bedroom across the landing, where her husband
      lay, the grim shadow of death itself was drawing momentarily closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the doctor had arrived in answer to the summons sent, there
      seemed small need for the strong cords with which Sir Adrian&rsquo;s limbs
      were bound. The wild fury of the afternoon&rsquo;s struggle had thoroughly
      exhausted him, and he lay, propped up with pillows, apparently in a state
      of stupor, breathing very feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart,&rdquo; the doctor told Tormarin after he had made a swift
      examination. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known for months that Sir Adrian might go
      out at any moment. His heart was already impaired, and, of course, he&rsquo;s
      drugged for years. He may recover a little, but if, as I think is highly
      probable, there&rsquo;s any recurrence of the brain disturbance&mdash;why,
      he&rsquo;ll not live out a second paroxysm. The heart won&rsquo;t stand
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin endeavoured to look appropriately shocked. But the doctor was a
      man and an honest one, and not even professional etiquette prevented his
      adding, with a jerk of his head in the direction of Claire&rsquo;s
      bedroom:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a merciful deliverance for that poor little woman.
      There&rsquo;s a strain of madness in the Latimer&rsquo;s you know. And&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a shrug&mdash;&ldquo;naturally Sir Adrian&rsquo;s habits have accentuated
      it in his own case.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the doctor was mistaken in his calculations. Sir Adrian&rsquo;s
      constitution was stronger than he estimated. As Nick had once bitterly
      commented to Jean, the man was like a piece of steel wire, and two
      dreadful outbreaks of maniacal fury had to be endured before the wire
      began to weaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the course of the first paroxysm it was all the four men could do
      to restrain him from leaping from the bed and rushing out of the room,
      since, during the period of quiescence which had preceded the doctor&rsquo;s
      arrival, a mistaken feeling of humanity had dictated the loosening of the
      cords which bound him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fought and screamed, uttering the most horrible imprecations, and his
      evil intent towards the woman who was his wife was unmistakable. With her
      husband free to work his will, Claire&rsquo;s life would not have been
      worth a moment&rsquo;s purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the period of coma that succeeded this outbreak Sir Adrian, was again
      secured, as mercifully as possible, from any possibility of doing his wife
      a mischief, and the second paroxysm which convulsed the bound and shackled
      madman was very terrible to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like its predecessor, this attack was followed by a stupor, during which
      Sir Adrian appeared more dead than alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was palpably weaker, restoratives failing to produce any appreciable
      effect, and towards morning, in those chill, small hours when the powers
      of the body languish and fail, the crazed and self-tormented spirit of
      Adrian Latimer quitted a world in which he had been able to perceive none
      of those things that are just and pure and lovely and of good report, but
      only distrust and malice and, finally, black hatred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight had come and gone. Sir Adrian&rsquo;s body had been laid to
      rest in Coombe Eavie churchyard, and Claire, in the simplest of widow&rsquo;s
      weeds, went about once more, looking rather frail and worn-out but with a
      fugitive light of happiness on her face that was a source of rejoicing to
      those who loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no pretence at mourning the man who had turned her life into a
      living hell for nearly three years and who stood like a gaoler betwixt her
      and the happiness which might have been hers had she been free. But the
      conventions, as well as her own feelings, dictated that a decent interval
      must elapse before she and Nick could be married, and this would be for
      her a quiet period dedicated to the readjustment of her whole attitude
      towards life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The length of that period was the subject of considerable discussion. Nick
      protested that six months was amply long enough to wait&mdash;too long
      indeed!&mdash;but Claire herself seemed disposed to prolong her widowhood
      into a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t in the least because I feel I owe it to Adrian,&rdquo;
      she said in answer to Nick&rsquo;s protest. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t consider
      that I owe him anything at all. But I feel so battered, Nick, so utterly
      tired and weary after the perpetual struggle of the last three years that
      I don&rsquo;t want to plunge suddenly into the new duties of a new life&mdash;not
      even into new happiness. It&rsquo;s difficult to make you understand, but
      I feel just like a sponge which has soaked up all it can and simply can&rsquo;t
      absorb any more of <i>anything</i>. You must let me have time for the past
      to evaporate a bit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it required the addition of a few common-sense observations on the
      part of Lady Anne to drive the nail home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Claire is quite right, Nick,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;She is
      temporarily worn out&mdash;mentally, physically and spiritually spent. Her
      nerves have been kept at their utmost stretch off and on for years, and
      now that release has come they&rsquo;ve collapsed like a fiddle-string
      when the peg that holds it taut is loosened. You must give her time to
      recover, to key herself up to normal pitch again. At present she isn&rsquo;t
      fit to face even the demands that big happiness brings in its train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So Nick had perforce to bow to Claire&rsquo;s decision, and it was settled
      that for the first month of two, at least, of her widowhood Jean should
      remove herself and her belongings from Staple and bear her company at
      Charnwood. And meanwhile Nick and Claire would spend many peaceful hours
      together of quiet happiness and companionship, while Claire, as she
      herself expressed it, &ldquo;rebuilt her soul.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jean the issue of events had brought nothing but pure joy. Her belief
      had been justified, and the grim gateway of death had become for these two
      friends of hers the gateway to happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had neither seen nor heard anything from Burke since the day she had
      fled from him on the Moor, although indirectly she had discovered that he
      had quitted the bungalow the day following that of her flight from it and
      had gone to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judith sent her a brief, rather formal letter of congratulation upon her
      engagement, but in it she made no reference to him nor did she endeavour
      to explain away or palliate her own share in his scheme to force Jean&rsquo;s
      hand. Probably an odd kind of loyalty to her brother prevented her from
      clearing herself at his expense, added to a certain dogged pride which
      refused to let her extenuate any action of hers; to the daughter of Glyn
      Peterson.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of these things had any power to hurt Jean now. In her new-born
      happiness she felt that she could find it in her heart to forgive anybody
      anything! She was even conscious of a certain tentative understanding and
      indulgence for Burke himself. He had only used the &ldquo;primitive man&rdquo;
      methods his temperament dictated in his effort to win the woman he wanted
      for his wife. And he had failed. Just now, Jean could not help
      sympathising with anybody who had failed to find the happiness that love
      bestows.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected that the old gipsy on the Moor had been wonderfully correct
      in her prophecy concerning Nick and Claire. The sun was &ldquo;shin&rsquo;
      butivul&rdquo; for them at last, just as she had assured them that it
      would.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with the same, came a sudden little clutch of fear at Jean&rsquo;s
      heart, like the touch of a strange hand. The gipsy had had other words for
      her&mdash;harsher, less sweet-sounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For there&rsquo;s darkness comin&rsquo;... black darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shivered a little. She felt as though a breath of cold air had passed
      over her, chilling the warm blood that ran so joyously in her veins.

      CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;AN UNWELCOME VISITOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>LAISE was seated
      at his study table, regarding somewhat dubiously a letter which lay open
      in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was written in a flowing, foreign hand and expressed with a quaintly
      stilted, un-English turn of phrase. The heading of the notepaper upon
      which it was inscribed was that of a hotel in Exeter.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Dear Mr. Tormarin,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;You will, without doubt, be
     surprised to receive a letter from me, since we have met
     only once. But I have something of the most great importance
     to confide in you, and I therefore beg that you will accord
     me an interview. When I add to this that the matter
     approaches very closely the future of your fiancée, Miss
     Peterson, I do not doubt to myself that you will appoint a
     time when I may call to see you.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The letter was signed <i>M. de Varigny</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise had received this thought-provoking epistle two days previously,
      and had been impressed by an uncomfortable consciousness that it foreboded
      something unpleasant. He could not imagine in what manner the affairs of
      Madame de Varigny impinged upon his own, or rather, as she seemed to
      imply, upon those of his future wife, and this very uncertainty had
      impelled him to fix the interview the Countess had demanded at as early a
      moment as possible. Disagreeables were best met and faced without delay.
      So now he was momentarily awaiting her arrival, still unable to rid
      himself of the impression that something of an unpleasant nature impended.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced through the open window, facing him. Afterwards, he was always
      able to recall every little detail of the picture upon which his eyes
      rested; it was etched upon his mind as ineffaceably as though cut upon
      steel with a graver&rsquo;s tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the mellow sunlight of September flooded the lawns and terraces,
      that indescribable change which heralds autumn had already begun to
      manifest itself. Not that any hint of chill as yet edged the balmy
      atmosphere or tint of russet reddened the gently waving foliage of the
      trees. It was something less definite&mdash;a suggestion of maturity, of
      completed ripening, conveyed by the deep, rich green of the grass, the
      strong, woody growth of the trees, the full-blown glory of the roses
      nodding on their stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the left, in the shade of a stately cedar, Lady Anne and Jean were
      encamped with their sewing and writing materials at hand, and the rays of
      sunshine, filtering between the widespread branches above them, woke
      fugitive gold and silver lights in the down-bent auburn and white-crowned
      heads. Further away, in the valley below, the brown smudge of a
      wide-bottomed boat broke the smooth expanse of the lake whence the mingled
      laughter of Nick and Claire came floating up on the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a peaceful scene, full of intimate happiness and tender promises,
      and Blaise watched it with contented eyes. The voice of Baines, formal and
      urbane, roused him from a pleasant reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame de Varigny,&rdquo; announced that functionary, throwing open
      the door and standing aside for the visitor to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise rose courteously to greet her, holding out his hand. But the
      Countess shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not shake hands,&rdquo; she said abruptly. &ldquo;When
      you know why I am come, you will not want to shake hands with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something not unattractive about the outspoken refusal to sail
      under false colours, more especially softened, as it was, by the charm of
      the faintly foreign accent and intonation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny had paused a moment in the middle of the room and was
      regarding her host with curiously appraising eyes, and as Blaise returned
      her gaze he was conscious, as once before at the fancy-dress ball at
      Montavan, of the strange sense of familiarity this woman had for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; he said, answering her refusal to shake
      hands. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you, at least, sit down?&rdquo; pulling forward
      a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will sit.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sank into the chair with the quick, graceful motion of the South, and
      continued to regard Blaise watchfully between the thick fringes of her
      lashes. Had Jean been present, she would have been struck anew by the
      expression of implacability which hardened the dark-brown eyes. By that,
      and by something else as well&mdash;a look of unmistakable triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have much&mdash;much to say to you, Monsieur Tor-ma-rin,&rdquo;
      she began at last. &ldquo;I will commence by telling you a little about
      myself. I am&rdquo;&mdash;here she looked away for an instant, then shot a
      swift, penetrating glance at him&mdash;&ldquo;an Italian by birth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief silence followed this announcement. Blaise was thinking
      concentratedly. So Madame de Varigny, despite her French name and her
      French mannerisms, was an Italian! He might have guessed it had the
      possibility ever definitely presented itself to him&mdash;guessed it from
      those broad, high cheek bones, those liquid, southern-dark eyes, and the
      coarse, blue-black hair. Yet, except for one fleeting moment at Montavan,
      the idea had never occurred to him, and it had then been swiftly
      dissipated by Jean&rsquo;s explanation that the impressive-looking
      Cleopatra was the Comtesse de Varigny and her chaperon for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Italian! Blaise felt more convinced than ever now that Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s
      visit portended unpleasant developments. Something, a voice from the past,
      was about to break stridently on the peaceful present. He braced himself
      to meet and counter whatever might be coming. Vaguely he foresaw some kind
      of blackmail, and he thanked Heaven for Jean&rsquo;s absolute
      understanding and complete knowledge of the past and of all that
      appertained to his first unhappy marriage. There would be little foothold
      here for an attempt at blackmail, however skilfully worked, he reflected
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He therefore responded civilly to Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s statement,
      apparently accepting it at its mere face value.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am surprised,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;You have altogether the
      air of a Parisian.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Countess smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had a French grandmother,&rdquo; she returned carelessly.
      &ldquo;Also, I have lived much in Paris.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that explains it,&rdquo; replied Tormarin, leaning back in his
      chair as though satisfied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the influence of environment
      and heredity, I expect.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was fencing carefully, waiting for the woman to show her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also Corsican blood in my veins,&rdquo; pursued Madame de
      Varigny. Then, as Tormarin made no answer, she leaned forward and said
      intently: &ldquo;Do you know the characteristic of the Corsicans, Monsieur
      Tor-ma-rin? They never forget&mdash;<i>nevaire</i>&rdquo;&mdash;her
      foreign accent increasing, as usual, with emotion of any kind. &ldquo;The
      Corsican always repays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes? And you have something to repay? Is that it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have something to repay.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A revenge, in fact?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I do not call it revenge. It is punishment&mdash;the just
      punishment earned by the man who married Nesta Freyne and brought her in
      return nothing but misery.&rdquo; Tormarin rose abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have the affairs of Nesta Freyne to do with you?&rdquo; he
      asked sternly. &ldquo;As you are obviously aware, she was my wife. And I
      do not propose to discuss private personal matters with an entire
      stranger.&rdquo; He moved towards the door. &ldquo;I think our interview
      can very well terminate at that. I do not wish to forget that I am your
      host.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are more than that,&rdquo; said Madame de Varigny suavely.
      &ldquo;You are my brother-in-law.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo; Tormarin swung &rsquo;round and faced her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The suavity was gone now, replaced by a curious deadly
      precision of utterance, enhanced by the foreign rendering of syllabic
      values. &ldquo;I am&mdash;or was, until my marriage&mdash;Margherita
      Valdi. I am Nesta&rsquo;s sister.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin regarded her steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will hear what you have to
      say. Though I don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that any good can
      come of raking up the past. It is better&mdash;forgotten.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten?&rdquo; Madame de Varigny seized upon the unlucky word.
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it may be easy enough for you to forget&mdash;you who
      took Nesta&rsquo;s young, beautiful life and crushed it; you who came like
      a thief and stole from me the one creature in the whole world whom I loved&mdash;my
      <i>bambina</i>, my little sister. Oh, yes&rdquo;&mdash;her voice rose
      passionately&mdash;&ldquo;easy enough when there is another woman&mdash;a
      new love&mdash;with whom you think to start your life all over again! But
      I tell you, you <i>shall not!</i> There shall be no new beginning for you&mdash;no
      marriage with this Jean Peterson to whom you are now <i>fiancé</i>. I
      forbid it&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise stemmed the torrent of her speech with an authoritative gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask how the news of my engagement reached you?&rdquo; he
      asked, his cool, dispassionate question falling like a hailstone dropped
      into some molten stream of lava.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have kept watch. I have the means of knowing. There is very
      little that has happened to you since&mdash;since I wrote to you of Nesta&rsquo;s
      death&rdquo;&mdash;she stumbled a little over the words, and Blaise,
      despite his anger, was conscious of a sudden flash of sympathy for her&mdash;&ldquo;very
      little that I have not known. And this&mdash;your engagement, I knew of
      that when it was barely a week old.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really curious to know why my affairs should be of such
      surpassing interest to you. My engagement, for instance&mdash;how did you
      hear of it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was easy&rdquo;&mdash;contemptuously. &ldquo;There was
      another man who loved your Mees Peterson&mdash;this Monsieur Burke. I used
      him. I knew he was afraid that you might win her, and I told him that if
      ever you became engaged he must come and tell me, and I would show him how
      to make sure that you should never marry her. Oh! That was <i>vairy</i>
      simple!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you promised him more than you can hope to
      perform. I grant that you have every reason to dislike me&mdash;hate me,
      if you will. I acknowledge, too, that I was to blame, miserably to blame,
      for Nesta&rsquo;s unhappiness&mdash;as much in fault as she herself. But
      there is nothing gained at this late hour by apportioning the blame. We
      each made bad mistakes&mdash;and we have each had to pay the price.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours has been a very light price&mdash;comparatively,&rdquo; she
      commented with intense bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the quiet, still utterance of the brief question brought her
      glance swiftly, curiously, back to his face. It was as though, behind
      those four short words, she could feel the intolerable pressure of years
      of endurance. For a moment she seemed to waver, then, as though she had
      deliberately pushed the impression aside, she laughed disagreeably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too light to satisfy her sister, at any rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin froze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is fortunate, then, that my ultimate fate does not lie in your
      hands,&rdquo; he observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is just where it does lie&mdash;in the palm of my hand&mdash;there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung out one shapely hand, palm, upward, and pointed to it with the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now&mdash;see&mdash;I close my hand&mdash;so!... And this
      beautiful marriage of which you have dreamed, your marriage with Mees
      Peterson&mdash;<i>it does not take place!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; asked Blaise contemptuously, experiencing all
      an Englishman&rsquo;s distaste for this display of unforced drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I am not mad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The air of theatricality seemed to fall suddenly away from her, leaving
      her a stern and sombre figure, invested with an intrinsic atmosphere of
      tragedy, filled with one sentiment only&mdash;the thirst for vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I am not mad. I am telling you the truth. You can never marry
      Jean Peterson, because Nesta&mdash;your wife&mdash;still lives.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin fell back a pace. For one moment he believed the woman had gone
      genuinely mad&mdash;that by dint of long brooding upon how she might most
      hurt and punish the Englishman whom she had never forgiven for marrying
      her sister, she had evolved from a half-crazed mind the belief that Nesta
      still lived and that thus she would be able to prevent his marriage with
      any other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, looking into those seeming soft brown eyes with the granite
      hardness in their depths, he could see the light of reason burning
      steadily within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny was quite sane, as sane as he was himself. And if so...
    </p>
    <p>
      A great fear came upon him&mdash;the fear of a man who dimly senses the
      approach of some appalling danger and knows that it will find him utterly
      defenceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo; he demanded, his voice
      roughened and uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. Nesta is alive,&rdquo; she repeated simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alive?</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The word was wrung from him, hardly more than a hoarse whisper of sound.
      He swung round upon her violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you yourself wrote and told me of her death?&rdquo; She nodded
      placidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I wrote a lie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the official information? We had that, too, later, from the
      French police, confirming your account. You had better be careful about
      what you are telling me,&rdquo; he added sternly. &ldquo;Lies won&rsquo;t
      answer, now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The need for lying is past,&rdquo; she answered with the most
      absolute candour. &ldquo;The French police wrote quite truthfully all they
      knew. They had found the body of a suicide, whom I identified as my
      sister. To strengthen matters I bribed someone I knew also to identify the
      dead girl as Nesta. She was a married woman, too, the poor little dead,
      one! So it was quite simple. And I took Nesta home&mdash;home to Château
      Varigny. I had married by then. But she had heard of my marriage through
      friends in Italy and wrote to me from there, telling me of her misery with
      you and begging me to succour her. So I went to Italy and brought her back
      with me to Varigny. Then I planned that you should believe her dead. It
      was all very simple,&rdquo; she repeated complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what was your object in all this? Why did you scheme to keep me
      in ignorance? What was your purpose?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Her voice deepened suddenly, the placid satisfaction
      with which she had narrated the carrying out of her plan disappearing from
      it completely. &ldquo;Why? I did it to punish you&mdash;first for stealing
      my Nesta from me and then because, after you had stolen her, you brought
      her nothing but misery and heart-break. She was so young&mdash;so young!
      And you, with your hideous temper and cold, formal English ways&mdash;you
      broke her heart, cowed her, crushed her!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was old enough to coquette with every man she met,&rdquo; came
      grimly between Tormarin&rsquo;s teeth. &ldquo;No husband&mdash;English or
      Italian, least of all Italian&mdash;would have endured her conduct.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would not have played with other men if you had loved her. She
      was all fire. And you&mdash;you were like a wet log that will not burn!&rdquo;
      She gestured fiercely. &ldquo;You <i>never</i> loved her! It was in a
      moment of passion&mdash;of desire that you married her!... But you were
      sure, eventually, to meet some other woman and learn what love&mdash;real
      love&mdash;is. So I waited. And when I saw you at Montavan with Jean&mdash;I
      knew that the day I had waited for so long would come at last. I knew that
      your punishment was ready to my hand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean&rdquo;&mdash;Blaise spoke in curiously measured accents&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you mean that you deliberately concealed the fact that Nesta still lived
      so that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you should not marry the woman that you loved when the time
      came! Yes, I planned it all! I kept Nesta safely hidden at Varigny, and I
      made little changes in her appearance&mdash;a woman can, you know&rdquo;&mdash;mockingly&mdash;&ldquo;the
      colour of her hair, the way of dressing it. Oh, just little changes, so
      that if by chance she was seen in the street by anyone who had known her
      as your wife she would not easily be recognised.&rdquo; Oh once more with
      that exasperating complacence at her own skill in deception&mdash;&ldquo;I
      thought of every little detail.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin stood listening to her silently, like a man in a trance. His face
      had grown drawn and haggard, and his eyes burned in their sockets. Once,
      as she poured out her story of trickery and deception, she heard him
      mutter dazedly: &ldquo;Jean... Jean,&rdquo; and the anguish in his voice
      might have moved any woman to pity save only one who was utterly and
      entirely obsessed with the desire for vengeance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the intolerable suffering which had suddenly lined his face and rimmed
      his mouth with tiny beads of sweat was meat and drink to her. She gloried
      in it. This was her hour of triumph after long years of waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have behaved very well,&rdquo; she pursued. &ldquo;I
      might have waited till you were actually married. But I have no wish to
      punish the little Jean. She, at least, is &lsquo;on the square,&rsquo; as
      you say&mdash;though it would have revenged my Nesta well had I waited.
      You ruined Nesta&rsquo;s life; I could have ruined the life of the woman
      you love. I did think of it. Ah! You would have suffered then, knowing
      that the Jean you worshipped was neither wife, nor maid, but a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Be silent, woman!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tortured beyond bearing, this final taunt, levelled at the woman he held
      more dear than anything in life, snapped his last thread of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung himself forward and his hands were gripping, gripping at the soft
      ivory throat from which the taunt had sprung. He felt the woman writhe,
      struggling to pull his hands from her neck. But it meant nothing to him.
      He did not think of her any longer as a woman. She was something vile&mdash;leprous
      to the very core of her being&mdash;a thing to be destroyed. The thing
      which had made of all Jean&rsquo;s promised happiness a black and bitter
      mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mad Tormarin rage surged through his veins like a consuming fire. He
      would break her&mdash;break her and utterly destroy her just as one
      destroyed a deadly snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then across the thunderous roar that beat in his ears came the beloved
      voice, the voice that would have power to call him out of the depths of
      hell itself&mdash;Jean&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise! Blaise! What are you doing? Stop!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;THE DIVIDING SWORD
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>LOWLY,
      reluctantly, Tormarin&rsquo;s hands loosened their clasp of Madame de
      Varigny&rsquo;s throat, and with a swift, flexible twist of the body she
      slipped aside and stood a few paces away from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean looked from one to the other with horrified eyes. &ldquo;Madame de
      Varigny?&mdash;Blaise?&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;What is it?... Why,
      you&mdash;you might have killed her, Blaise!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her blankly. His release of the Italian woman had been in
      mere blind response to Jean&rsquo;s first imperative appeal that he should
      desist But the mists of ungovernable anger had hardly yet cleared from his
      brain; the blood still drummed in his ears like the roar of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise&rdquo;&mdash;Jean spoke imploringly. &ldquo;What were you
      doing? Tell me&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With an effort he seemed to recover himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t let me finish it, Jean,&rdquo;
      he said harshly. &ldquo;Such women are better dead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Varigny was fingering her neck delicately where the pressure of
      Blaise&rsquo;s grip had scored red marks on the cream-like flesh. She
      seemed quite composed. Her smile still held its quiet triumph and her long
      dark eyes gleamed with the same mockery that had brought her within
      measureable distance of quick death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As Monsieur Tor-ma-rin seems to find a difficulty in explaining&mdash;permit
      me,&rdquo; she said at last &ldquo;He was angry with me because I bring
      him the good news that his wife is still alive, that he need mourn no
      longer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke her eyes, resting on Blaise&rsquo;s mask-like face, held
      an expression of malicious satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife... alive?&rdquo; repeated Jean dazedly. &ldquo;Blaise, is
      she mad? Nesta has been dead years&mdash;years.&rdquo; Then, as he made no
      answer, she continued rapidly, a faint note of fear vibrating in her
      voice: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it so? Blaise&mdash;speak! Quickly, tell her&mdash;Nesta
      has been dead some years!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot tell me anything about her which I do not know already,
      Mees Peterson, seeing that she is my sister and has been living with me
      ever since her husband&rsquo;s cruelty drove her from his home.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Blaise?&rdquo; whispered Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Belief that some substance of terrible truth lay behind the Italian&rsquo;s
      coolly uttered statements was beginning to lay hold of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise, Blaise&rdquo;&mdash;her voice rising a little&mdash;&ldquo;say
      it isn&rsquo;t true&mdash;tell her it isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her speechlessly, but the measureless pain in his eyes
      answered her more fully, more convincingly than any words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see?&rdquo; broke in Madame de Varigny triumphantly. &ldquo;He
      cannot deny it! It was I who told him of her death and I who now tell him
      that she still lives. Listen to me, mademoiselle, and I will recount you
      how&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; interrupted Jean proudly. &ldquo;Whatever there may be
      for me to hear, I will hear it from Blaise&mdash;not from you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned again to Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me everything, Blaise,&rdquo; she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her outstretched hands and drew her slowly towards him. No one,
      reading now the calm sadness, the stern imprint of endurance on his face,
      could have imagined it was that of the same man who, a few moments
      earlier, had been swept by such a tempest of uncontrollable anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean,&rdquo; he said very gently and pitifully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid that what Madame de Varigny says may be true. I have no proof that
      it is not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor have you any proof that it is,&rdquo; broke in Jean swiftly.
      She swung round on Madame de Varigny. &ldquo;Where is your proof&mdash;where
      is your proof?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monsieur Tor-ma-rin will find his wife in my car. I bade the
      chauffeur wait with it at the lodge gate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean you have brought Nesta&mdash;<i>here?</i>&rdquo; cried
      Blaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Madame do Varigny, with a return to the
      same exasperating complacency with which she had originally described her
      whole scheme of revenge. &ldquo;And&mdash;<i>here?</i> Surely her husband&rsquo;s
      house is the proper place to which to bring his wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She cannot remain here,&rdquo; said Blaise with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? For the moment that was not my idea. I brought her with me
      because I thought there could be no more convincing proof.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise looked at her searchingly. He fancied he detected a false note in
      her voluble speech, and a new idea presented itself to him. Was the woman
      simply putting up a gigantic bluff? Or was it really Nesta, his wife,
      waiting in the car at the lodge gates? It occurred to him as perfectly
      feasible that it might be merely some woman whose remarkable resemblance
      to the dead girl had suggested to the Countess&rsquo;s fertile brain the
      scheme that she should impersonate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind seized eagerly upon the idea, bolstering it up with Madame de
      Varigny&rsquo;s own admissions. &ldquo;<i>I made little changes in her
      appearance</i>,&rdquo; she had said. &ldquo;<i>The colour of her hair, the
      way of dressing it</i>.&rdquo; Probably she was relying on those &ldquo;little
      changes,&rdquo; and on the blurred recollection resulting from the length
      of time which had elapsed since Nesta&rsquo;s death, to aid her in her
      plan of introducing as his wife a woman who closely resembled her. He felt
      morally sure of it, and the light of hope suddenly shone bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are deceiving me,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Lying&mdash;as
      you have lied all through the piece. I&rsquo;ll come and see this &lsquo;wife&rsquo;
      you have waiting in the car for me&rdquo;&mdash;grimly. He turned to Jean.
      &ldquo;Keep up your courage, sweetheart&rdquo; he said in a low voice full
      of infinite solicitude. &ldquo;I believe the whole thing is a put-up job
      to separate us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean smiled at him radiantly. She felt all at once very confident. In a
      few minutes this nightmarish story of a Nesta still alive and claiming her
      rights as Blaise&rsquo;s wife would be proved a lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin crossed the room and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Madame de Varigny&mdash;will you come with me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman hesitated a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; insisted Blaise firmly. &ldquo;Or&mdash;are you
      afraid, after all, to bring me face to face with my wife?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not afraid. It is only that I am
      so sorry&mdash;so sorry for the little Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes, soft and dark and liquid as the eyes of a deer, sought Jean&rsquo;s
      beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; she repeated. And passed, slowly,&mdash;almost
      unwillingly, it seemed, out of the room, followed by Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean raised her head from Blaise&rsquo;s shoulder and pushed back her
      hair, damp with perspiration, from her forehead. It seemed to her as
      though she had been down, down into some awful, limitless abyss of
      darkness from which she was now feebly struggling back to a painful
      consciousness of material things. A great sea had surged over her head,
      blotting out everything, and remained poised above her like a huge black
      arch, imprisoning her in the vast, deserted chaos in which she found
      herself wandering. Then&mdash;after a long time, it seemed&mdash;it had
      surged away again and she could distinguish Blaise&rsquo;s face bent above
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then it&rsquo;s true?&rdquo; she said stupidly. Her
      voice sounded tiny, even to herself&mdash;a mere thread of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise made no answer. He only held her a little closer in his arms. She
      supposed he hadn&rsquo;t heard that thin little thread of voice. She must
      try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Blaise? Is Nesta&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But somehow the
      last word wouldn&rsquo;t come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his arm jerk against her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said baldly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true. Nesta is alive.
      I&rsquo;ve seen her.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean said nothing. She knew it&mdash;had known it all the time the arched
      wall of sea had kept her down in that awful black waste where there had
      been neither warmth nor sunshine but only bitter, freezing cold and
      lightless space. She clung a little closer to Blaise, like a frightened,
      exhausted child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heart&rsquo;s beloved... little <i>dearest</i> Jean...&rdquo; She
      heard the wrung murmur of his voice above her head. Then suddenly, his
      arms tightening round her: &ldquo;<i>My soul!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunlight still slanted in through the windows, mellow and golden. A
      gay shout of laughter came up from the boat on the lake. The clock on the
      chimney-piece struck the hour&mdash;twelve slow, maddening strokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at its blank, foolish face. The hands had pointed to half-past
      eleven when the door of the room had closed behind Blaise and Madame de
      Varigny. It had taken just a brief half-hour to smash up her whole world&mdash;to
      rob her of everything that mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must think&mdash;I must think,&rdquo; she muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belovedest&rdquo;&mdash;Blaise&rsquo;s voice was wonderfully tender&mdash;not
      with the passionate tenderness of a lover but with a solicitude that was
      almost maternal. &ldquo;Belovedest, don&rsquo;t try to think now. Try to
      rest a little, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at that Jean came right back to an understanding of all that had
      happened, as the needle of a compass swings back to the frozen north.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rest?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;<i>Rest?</i> Do you realise that I
      shall have all the remainder of life to&mdash;rest in? There&rsquo;ll he
      nothing else to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She released herself very gently from Tormarin&rsquo;s arms and, crossing
      the room to the window, stood looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; she said in a rather high-pitched, uncertain
      voice. &ldquo;It all looks just the same&mdash;although everything in the
      world is changed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He came and stood beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Nothing is changed, dear. Our
      love is the same as it was before. Always remember that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t every marry now.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We can&rsquo;t marry&mdash;now. You&rsquo;ll never have the
      Tormarin temper to bear with, after all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand swiftly across his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was dreadful!&rdquo; she said, recalling the terrible scene
      which she had interrupted. &ldquo;It&mdash;it hardly seemed&mdash;<i>you</i>,
      Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the moment it wasn&rsquo;t. It was the Tormarin devil&mdash;the
      curse of every generation. But I think that Varigny woman could turn a
      saint into a devil if she tried! She said something about you&mdash;and I
      couldn&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that it? Then I suppose I shall have to forgive you&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a pale little attempt at a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the half-hearted smile faded again almost instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Blaise, what would your temper matter if we could still be
      together?&rdquo; she cried passionately. &ldquo;Nothing in the wide world
      would matter then!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s worse for you than for me. I wish it were more
      equal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How worse for me? I don&rsquo;t understand. Unless&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a brief, sad smile&mdash;&ldquo;you love me less?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you know I don&rsquo;t mean that! But I&rsquo;ve only the
      separation to face. I&rsquo;m not tied to somebody I don&rsquo;t love. You&rsquo;ve
      got Nesta to consider.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nesta?&rdquo; He gave a short, grim laugh. &ldquo;Nesta can go back
      to where she came from.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. At last Jean broke it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise, you can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;you can&rsquo;t send her away
      again,&rdquo; she said in quick, low tones. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s your wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife! She seems to have been oblivious of the fact&mdash;and to
      have wished me to be equally oblivious of it&mdash;for the last few years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course she&rsquo;s been wrong, wickedly wrong. But that
      doesn&rsquo;t alter the fact that she&rsquo;s your responsibility, Blaise.
      You must take her back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take her back?&rdquo;&mdash;violently. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be shot if
      I do! She&rsquo;s chosen to live her life without me for the last few
      years&mdash;she can continue to do so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean laid her hand on his arm. She was smiling wistfully. &ldquo;Dear, you&rsquo;ll
      have to take her back,&rdquo; she persisted gently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      see&mdash;she&rsquo;s not wholly to blame? You&rsquo;ve admitted that. You&rsquo;ve
      blamed yourself in a large measure for her running away. It&rsquo;s up to
      you now to put things straight, to&mdash;to give her the chance she didn&rsquo;t
      have before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re discounting these last few years,&rdquo; he returned
      gravely. &ldquo;These years in which she has lived a lie, allowing me to
      believe her dead&mdash;-cheating and deceiving me as no man was ever
      cheated before. She&rsquo;s cheated me out of my happiness&rdquo;&mdash;heavily&mdash;&ldquo;taken
      <i>you</i> from me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo; Jean&rsquo;s voice quivered, but she steadied
      it again. &ldquo;But even in that, she was not solely to blame. You&rsquo;ve
      told me how&mdash;how weak she is and easily led astray. And she&rsquo;s
      very young. What chance would Nesta have of asserting her will against her
      sister&rsquo;s, even had she wished to return to you? She ran away from
      Staple in a fit of temper and because you had frightened her. After that&mdash;you
      can see for yourself&mdash;Madame de Varigny is responsible for everything
      that has happened since.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormarin remained silent. The quiet justice of Jean&rsquo;s summing up of
      the situation struck at him hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited a moment, then added quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must take her back, Blaise.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled round on her violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You? Did you ever love me,
      Jean, that you can talk so coolly about turning me over to another woman?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She whitened at the bitter accusation in his tones, but she did not
      flinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just <i>because</i> I love you, Blaise, that I want you
      to do this thing&mdash;to do the only thing that is worthy of you. Oh, my
      dear, my dear&rdquo;&mdash;her hands went out to him in sudden, helpless
      pleading&mdash;&ldquo;do you think it&rsquo;s <i>easy</i> for me to ask
      it?&rdquo; The desolate cry pierced him. He caught her in his arms,
      kissing her fiercely, adoringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart!... Forgive me! I&rsquo;m half mad, I think. Beloved,
      say that you forgive me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against him, glad to feel the straining clasp of his arms about
      her&mdash;to rest once more in her place against his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest of all,&rdquo; she said tremulously, &ldquo;there is no
      question of forgiveness between us two. There never will be. We&rsquo;re
      just&mdash;both of us&mdash;struggling in the dark, and there&rsquo;s only
      duty&rdquo;&mdash;brokenly&mdash;&ldquo;only duty to hold to.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood together in silence, comforted just a little by the mere human
      touch of each other in this communion of sorrow which had so suddenly come
      upon them, yet knowing in their hearts that this was the very comfort that
      must for ever be denied them in the lonely future.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Jean raised her head from its resting-place and her eyes searched
      Blaise&rsquo;s face, asking the question she could no longer bring herself
      to put in words. He met their gaze. &ldquo;Jean, is it your wish I do this
      thing&mdash;take Nesta back?&rdquo; He felt a shudder run through her
      frame. Twice she tried ineffectually to answer. At last she forced her dry
      lips to utter an affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer sounded in her ears like the knell to the whole meaning of
      life. The future was settled. Henceforth their lives must lie apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Blaise. &ldquo;She shall come back and take
      her place again at Staple.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean clung to him a little closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise, beloved&mdash;I know the harder part will be yours. But
      mine won&rsquo;t be easy, dear. I shall go to Charnwood to be with Claire
      at once&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;and it won&rsquo;t be easy, when I see in an
      evening the lights twinkle up at Staple, to know that you two are within,
      shut in from the world together, while I&rsquo;m outside&mdash;always
      outside your life and your love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never be outside my love,&rdquo; he said swiftly.
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yours, now and forever. And no other woman shall rob
      you of one jot or tittle of it, were she my wife twenty times over. I will
      bring Nesta back to Staple, and she shall bear my name and live as my wife
      in the eyes of the world. But my love&mdash;that is yours, utterly and
      entirely. Yours and no other&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her face to his, and their lips met in a kiss that was the seal
      of love and all love&rsquo;s faithfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So is mine yours,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How and forever, in this
      world and the next. Oh, Blaise&mdash;beloved!&rdquo;&mdash;she clung to
      him in a passion of love and anguish and straining belief&mdash;&ldquo;Some
      day, surely, in that other world, God will give us freedom to take our
      happiness!&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO months had
      elapsed since Fate&rsquo;s dividing sword had fallen, forever separating
      Jean from the man she loved, and the subsequent march of events, with the
      many changes involved and the bitter loneliness of soul entailed, had made
      the two months seem to her more like two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had left Staple for Charnwood on the day following that of Madame de
      Varigny&rsquo;s visit. It was no longer possible for her to remain under
      the same roof with Blaise, where the enforced strain of meeting each other
      daily, and of endeavouring to behave as though nothing more than mere
      commonplace friendship linked them together, would have been too great for
      either of them to endure even for the few remaining days which still
      intervened before the date originally planned for her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne, with her usual sympathetic insight, had made no effort to
      dissuade her, reluctant though she had been to part with her. For herself,
      the fact that Nesta was alive had come upon her in the light of an almost
      overwhelming blow. She had never liked the girl, whereas she had grown to
      look upon Jean as a beloved daughter, and no one had rejoiced more
      sincerely than his mother when Blaise had confided to her the news of his
      engagement. At last she would see that grey page in his life turned down
      for ever and the beginning of a newer, fairer page, illuminated with
      happiness! And instead, like a tide that has receded far out and then
      rushes in again with redoubled energy, the whole misery and sorrow of the
      past had returned upon him, a thousand times accentuated by reason of his
      love for Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a heavy heart, therefore, that Lady Anne, together with Nick,
      quitted Staple and established herself for the second time at the Dower
      House, retiring thither in favour of Nesta who was now installed once more
      at the Manor. And the thought of how gladly she would have effected the
      same change, had it been Jean whom Blaise was bringing home as his bride,
      added but a keener pang to her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She watched with anxious eyes the progress of events at Staple. At the
      commencement of the new régime Nesta had appeared genuinely repentant and
      ashamed of her conduct in the past, and there was something disarming in
      the little, half-apologetic air with which she had at first reassumed her
      position of châtelaine of Staple, deferring eagerly to Blaise on every
      point and trying her utmost to please him and conform to his wishes. It
      held something of the appeal of a forgiven child who tries to atone for
      former naughtiness by an almost alarming access of virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She accepted with meek docility Blaise&rsquo;s decision regarding the
      purely formal relations upon which their married life was henceforth to be
      based, apparently humbly thankful to be reinstated as his wife on any
      terms whatsoever that he chose to dictate..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I have been bad&mdash;<i>bad</i>,&rdquo; she declared,
      &ldquo;to run away and leave you like that. I can&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;forlornly&mdash;&ldquo;hope
      for you to love me again&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Tormarin had replied with unmistakable decision:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t hope for that. And I&rsquo;m glad you
      understand and recognise the fact. Still, we can try to be good friends,
      Nesta, at least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But this tranquil state of things only lasted for a comparatively short
      time. Very soon, as the novelty and satisfaction of her reinstatement
      began to wear off, Nesta became more self-assured and, apparently,
      considerably less frequently visited by spasms of repentance and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her butterfly nature could retain no very deep impression for any length
      of time, and gradually the characteristics of the old Nesta&mdash;the
      pettish, self-willed, pleasure-loving woman of former times&mdash;began to
      reassert themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise tried hard to exercise forbearance with her and to treat her, at
      least with justice and with a certain meed of kindliness. But she did not
      second his efforts. Instead, she became more exigeant and difficult as
      time passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was no longer satisfied by the fact that she was once more installed
      as the mistress of Staple. She demanded a husband who would surround her
      with all the little observances that only love itself can dictate, whom
      she could alternately scold and cajole as the fancy took her, but who
      would always come back to her, after a tiff, ready anew to play the
      adoring lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Blaise&rsquo;s cool, measured, elder-brotherly kindness
      unendurable, and she exhausted herself beating continually against the
      rock of his determination, without producing any effect other than to make
      his manner even more austere, less friendly than it had been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when she recognised her total inability to move him to any sort of
      responsive emotion, and that her beauty&mdash;which was undeniable&mdash;made
      no more impression upon him than if he had been blind, she resorted to the
      old, painfully, familiar weapons of tears and fits of temper, in the
      course of which she would upbraid him bitterly, pouring forth streams of
      reproaches which more often than not culminated in an attack of hysterics.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of which Blaise bore with a curious, stoical self-control. It seemed
      as though the Tormarin temper had been exorcised, as if that fierce storm
      of anger provoked by Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s taunts, and which had so
      nearly resulted in a tragedy, had shocked Blaise into realisation of the
      terrible latent possibilities of the family failing and the absolute
      necessity for an iron self-government.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks he supported Nesta&rsquo;s petty gibes and ebullitions of temper
      with illimitable patience, and it was only when, trading on his
      unaccustomed forbearance, she ventured too far, that she was brought very
      suddenly to understand that there was a limit beyond which she might not
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know why you no longer love me,&rdquo; she told him at last, on
      an occasion when she had been vainly endeavouring, by every feminine
      blandishment and wile of which she was mistress, to evoke from him some
      sign of an awakening <i>tendresse</i>. &ldquo;I know!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her dark head significantly, while pin-points of jealous anger
      flickered in her long, narrow eyes, black as midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, if you know,&rdquo; replied Tormarin patiently, &ldquo;it is
      surely most foolish of you to keep asking why I do not. Why can&rsquo;t
      you content yourself with things as they are, Nesta? We can only try to
      make the best of a bad job. You don&rsquo;t help me much in the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to help you,&rdquo; she retorted viciously.
      &ldquo;I want you to love me. And you won&rsquo;t, because of that
      washed-out-looking, carroty-haired woman who is living with Lady Latimer.
      And she&rsquo;s in love with you, too!... No! I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> be
      quiet! Oh!&rdquo;&mdash;her voice rising hysterically&mdash;&ldquo;you
      think I don&rsquo;t notice things, but I do. I do, I tell you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up from the couch, where she had been lolling indolently amid a
      heap of cushions, and crossed the room to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear me?&rdquo; she cried violently, shaking him by the arm.
      &ldquo;You think I&rsquo;m a blind fool! But I&rsquo;m not! I&rsquo;m not!
      I&rsquo;ve seen that Peterson woman looking at you like a cat looking
      through the larder window&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt Blaise&rsquo;s hand clapped against her lips, stemming
      the torrent of vulgar recrimination and abuse that poured from them. He
      held it there quite gently, so as not to hurt her, but immovably, and she
      had perforce to hear what he wished to say in rebellious silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;It is quite true what
      you say&mdash;that I love Jean Peterson and that she loves me. But we have
      given up our love, and with it our hope of happiness in this world, for
      you. In return, you will give up something for us. You will give up the
      infinite pleasure you appear to derive from vilifying and belittling a
      woman who is as much above you as the heavens are above the earth, whose
      conception of love is as fine and pure as yours is mean and commonplace
      and jealous. You will never again speak to Miss Peterson with anything but
      respect, nor will you ever again refer to the love which you now know for
      a fact exists between us. Your lips soil such love as ours. If you do, if
      you disobey my commands in either of these respects, you go out of my
      house that same day. <i>And you don&rsquo;t return.</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He released her and had the satisfaction, for once, of perceiving that she
      believed he meant what he said. Presumably she came to the conclusion
      that, in the circumstances, discretion was the better part of valour, for
      she made no attempt to challenge his determination in the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, unknown to him, she compelled Jean to pay for the
      silence enforced upon her at home. With a species of venom, absurdly
      childish in its manifestation, she essayed to excite Jean&rsquo;s envy by
      constantly enlarging to her upon the subject of Blaise&rsquo;s perfections
      as a husband, drawing entirely imaginary descriptions of the attention he
      paid her and of his constant solicitude for her welfare, and vaunting her
      happiness at being his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so proud to have won so fine and splendid a husband,&rdquo;
      she would declare fervently. &ldquo;Would you not feel the same, Miss
      Peterson, if you were me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jean would make answer, outwardly unmoved:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I should. You ought to be a happy woman, Mrs. Tormarin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet composure which Jean invariably opposed to these knat-like
      attacks annoyed Nesta intensely. Endowed with all the petty jealousy of a
      small nature, she herself, had the situation been reversed, would have
      found this pinprick kind of warfare insupportable, and it made her furious
      that her best thought-out and most spiteful efforts failed to goad Jean
      into any expression of either anger or distress. The &ldquo;cold
      Englishwoman&rsquo;s&rdquo; armour of indifference and reserve seemed
      impervious to no matter what poison-tipped dart she loosed against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nesta felt that, as the woman in possession, she was missing half the
      satisfaction in life by reason of her inability to triumph openly over the
      other woman&mdash;the woman without the gate. Finally, at the end of her
      resources of innuendo and allusion, she tried the effect of open warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had driven over to Charnwood to call and, as Claire was away, spending
      the afternoon with friends, Jean had perforce to entertain her undesired
      visitor alone. It was just as she was preparing to take her departure that
      Nesta launched her attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look so ill, Miss Peterson,&rdquo; she remarked
      commiseratingly. &ldquo;So pale and worn! It does not suit you, I am sure,
      for of course you must have been very pretty at one time for my husband to
      have wished to marry you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at her without reply. The outrageous speech almost took her
      breath away, by its sheer, impudent bravado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; Nesta feigned dismay. &ldquo;Now I have offended you!
      And I so want us to be good friends. But of course&rdquo;&mdash;quickly&mdash;&ldquo;it
      is difficult for you to feel friendly towards the wife of Blaise. I can
      understand that. I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;her head a little tilted to one
      side like that of an enquiring robin and her eyes fastened on the other&rsquo;s
      white face with a merciless, gimlet gaze that filled Jean with helpless
      rage&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose you loved him <i>very</i> much?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt the blood rush into her cheeks and caught a responsive gleam of
      satisfaction in the other&rsquo;s half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is hardly a subject which can be discussed between us,&rdquo;
      she said, with a supreme effort at self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, to her unbounded thankfulness, Tucker threw open the door and
      announced that Mrs. Tormarin&rsquo;s car was waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This open declaration of hostility on Nesta&rsquo;s part gave Jean food
      for reflection. Briefly she recounted the incident to Claire, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means I must not go to Staple again. If she intends to adopt
      that attitude, it would make a situation which is already quite difficult
      enough hopelessly impossible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls were pacing up and down the terrace at Charnwood together
      when Jean indicated the consequences of Nesta&rsquo;s visit, and Claire,
      sensing the pain in her friend&rsquo;s voice, pressed her arm
      sympathetically. But she said nothing. What was there to say? Within
      herself, she felt that Jean&rsquo;s determination to eschew the Tormarin
      menage altogether was the only wise one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Blaise!&rdquo; pursued Jean, a slight tremor in her voice.
      &ldquo;He has the hardest part to bear. She must make life hideously
      difficult for him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is looking very fagged and strained. Horrid little beast!&rdquo;
      she added with unusual vehemence. &ldquo;Why on earth couldn&rsquo;t she
      have <i>stayed</i> dead?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean laughed joylessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why indeed?&mdash;Only she never really died, you see.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean&rdquo;&mdash;Claire&rsquo;s hand crept further along the other&rsquo;s
      arm and the kind little fingers sought and clasped Jean&rsquo;s own&mdash;&ldquo;if
      you knew how miserable I am about you! It makes me feel wicked&mdash;disgustingly
      selfish and wicked!&mdash;to be so happy myself when you have so much to
      bear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in her voice, and Jean squeezed her hand reassuringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;you had your black years
      if anyone ever had! If a woman ever deserved her happiness at last, you
      do.... I suppose we all get our share of trouble in this world,&rdquo; she
      went on thoughtfully. &ldquo;I remember the first time I ever met Blaise&mdash;that
      day at Montavan, you know&mdash;he said that Destiny, with her snuffers,
      came to most of us sooner or later and snuffed out our light of happiness.
      Well&rdquo;&mdash;rather drearily&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s my
      turn now and she&rsquo;s come to me. That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little wind blew up from the valley, chill and complaining. Autumn had
      the world at her mercy now, and a grey mist was rising from the sodden
      fields, soaked by the continual rains of the preceding fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s growing too
      cold to stay out any longer. Besides, it&rsquo;s depressing. Grey skies,
      bare branches&mdash;Oh! How I detest the autumn!&rdquo; They turned and
      retraced their steps to the house. As they entered by way of the front
      door, they caught a glimpse of the postman making his way briskly down the
      drive. A solitary letter lay upon the hall table, addressed to Jean in a
      rather flourishy copper-plate style of writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bill, I suppose!&rdquo; she commented indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked it up carelessly, carrying it unopened to her room. Nor did she
      open it immediately upon arriving there, stopping first to remove her hat
      and coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she slit the envelope she found that it was no tradesman&rsquo;s
      bill, as she had imagined, but a letter from Glyn Peterson&rsquo;s family
      solicitor, announcing, in the stiff phraseology without which no lawyer
      seems able to express himself, the sudden death of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sat down abruptly, her legs seeming all at once to give way under
      her. She could not grasp it&mdash;could not realise that the witty,
      charming personality which, after all, in spite of Peterson&rsquo;s lack
      of the more conventional paternal attributes, had meant a great deal to
      her, had been swept without warning out of her life for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glyn Peterson had, it seemed, died very suddenly, in a remote corner of
      Africa whither his restless wanderings had led him, and it had been some
      weeks before the news of his death had reached his lawyer, who had
      immediately communicated it to Jean.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his will, everything he possessed, except for a certain sum set aside
      to cover a few legacies to old and valued servants, was left to Jean, and
      with the quaint whimsicality which was characteristic of him he had
      particularly mentioned: &ldquo;<i>Beirnfels, the House of Dreams-Come-True</i>.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little phrase, with its suggestion of joyous consummation, stabbed her
      with a sharp thrill of pain. Greeting her, as it did, at the moment when
      all her hopes of happiness were lying trampled beneath the iron heel of
      hostile destiny, it seemed to add a last touch of irony to the bitterness
      of the burden she had to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The House of Dreams-Come-True! In the solicitude and silence of her room
      Jean laughed out loud at the mockery of it! But her breath caught in her
      throat, sobbingly, and then quite suddenly the merciful, healing tears
      began to fall, and, laying her head down on her arms, she cried
      unrestrainedly.

      CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;THE TEST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EW YEAR&rsquo;S
      EYE found Jean sitting alone in Claire&rsquo;s special sanctum&mdash;the
      room which had witnessed that frightful scene when Sir Adrian had suddenly
      gone mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cosy enough little room in winter-time. A cheery fire crackled in
      the open grate, while a heavy velvet curtain was drawn across the door
      that gave egress to the terrace, effectually screening out the ubiquitous
      draught which invariably seeks entry through crack and hinge-space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire was at the Dower House this evening, where a New Year&rsquo;s
      dinner-party was in progress, but Jean had no heart for festivities of any
      kind even had she not been precluded from taking part in them by reason of
      her father&rsquo;s death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The grief and strain of the last four months had set their mark upon her.
      She was much thinner than formerly&mdash;her extreme slenderness
      accentuated by the clinging black of the dress she was wearing&mdash;while
      faint purple shadows lay beneath her eyes, giving her a look of frailty
      and fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Claire led a very sober and uneventful existence at Charnwood, the
      one absorbed in her quiet happiness, the other in her quiet grief. But the
      bond of their friendship had held true throughout the differing fortunes
      which had fallen to the lot of each, and although for Jean there was
      inevitable additional pain involved in still remaining within the
      neighbourhood of Staple, it was counterbalanced by the comfort she drew
      from Clare&rsquo;s companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, as she reflected dispiritedly, where else had she to go? The
      Dower House would have been open to her, of course, at any time, but there
      she would be certain to encounter Blaise more frequently, and of late her
      principal preoccupation had been to avoid such meeting whenever possible.
      And she could not face Beirnfels yet&mdash;alone! Some day, when Claire
      was married, she knew that she must brace herself to return there&mdash;to
      a house of dreams that would never come true now. But at present she
      shrank intolerably from the idea. She craved companionship&mdash;above
      all, the consoling, tender understanding which Claire, who had herself
      suffered, was so well able to give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book that she had been reading earlier in the evening lay open on her
      knee, and her thoughts were with Claire now. She pictured her sitting next
      to Nick at dinner, her flower-like face radiant with unclouded happiness,
      and Jean was thankful to the very bottom of her heart that she was able to
      feel glad&mdash;glad of that happiness. At least her own sorrow had not
      yet taught her the grudging envy which cannot endure another&rsquo;s joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a quickly repressed sigh, she turned again to her book. Its pages
      fluttered faintly, as though stirred by some passing current of air, and
      Jean, coming suddenly out of her reverie, was conscious of a cool draught
      wafting towards her from the direction of the terrace door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely surprised, she glanced up, and a startled cry broke from her lips.
      The door was open, the folds of the curtain had been drawn aside, and in
      the aperture stood Blaise Tormarin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean sprang up from her chair and stood staring at him with dilated eyes,
      one hand gripping the edge of the chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise!... You!&rdquo; The words issued stammeringly from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he returned shortly. &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting for an answer he closed the door behind him, letting the
      curtain fall back into its place, and crossed the room to her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean felt her heart contract as her eyes marked the changes wrought in him
      by the few weeks which had elapsed since she had seen him. His face was
      haggard as though from lack of sleep, and the lines on either side the
      mouth were scored deep into the flesh. The mouth itself closed in a tense
      line of savage misery and the stark bitterness of his eyes filled her with
      grief and pity, knowing how utterly powerless she was to help or comfort
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distrusting her self-control, she snatched at the first conventional
      remark that suggested itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought&mdash;I thought you and Nesta were both dining at the
      Dower House,&rdquo; she said confusedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nesta is there. I made an excuse. I came here instead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in the curt, clipped sentences sounded a note of warning in her
      ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ought not to have come here,&rdquo; she replied quickly&mdash;defensively
      almost. &ldquo;Why have you come, Blaise?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;because I can&rsquo;t bear my
      life without you a day longer. Because&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Jean! Jean!... <i>Beloved!</i>
      Do you need to ask me why I came?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift, irresistible movement he swept her up into his arms, holding
      her crushed against his breast, his mouth on hers, kissing her as a man
      kisses when love that has been long thwarted and denied at last bursts
      asunder the shackles which constrained it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jean, starved for four long months of the touch of the beloved arms,
      the pressure of the beloved lips upon her own, had yielded to him almost
      before she was aware of her surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the remembrance of the woman who stood between them rushed across her
      and she tore herself free from his embrace, white and trembling in every
      limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise!... Blaise!... What are you thinking of? Oh! We&rsquo;re mad&mdash;mad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She covered her face with her shaking hands but he drew them away, gazing
      down at her with eyes that worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, beloved, we&rsquo;re not mad,&rdquo; lie cried triumphantly.
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re sane&mdash;sane at last. We were mad to think we could
      live apart, mad to dream we could starve love like ours. That was when we
      were mad! But we&rsquo;ll never be parted again; sweet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise,&rdquo; she whispered, staring at him with horrified,
      dilated eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you are saying! You&rsquo;re
      forgetting Nesta&mdash;your wife. Oh, go&mdash;go quickly! You must not
      stay here and talk like this to me!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go, Jean. I&rsquo;ve
      come to take you away with me.&rdquo; Once more his arms went round her.
      &ldquo;Belovedest, I can&rsquo;t live without you any longer. I&rsquo;ve
      tried&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t do it. Jean, you&rsquo;ll come? You love me
      enough&mdash;enough to come away with me to the ends of the earth where we&rsquo;ll
      find happiness at last?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sought to free herself from his, clasp, pressing with straining hands
      against his chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No!&rdquo; she cried breathlessly. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go with
      you... you know I can&rsquo;t! Ah! Don&rsquo;t ask me, Blaise!&rdquo;
      There was an agony of supplication in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do ask you. And if you love me&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes holding
      hers&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll come, Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love you,&rdquo; she answered earnestly. &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t
      the you I love asking me this, Blaise. It&rsquo;s some other man&mdash;a
      stranger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love me, you&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; he reiterated doggedly.
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live without you, Jean. I want you&mdash;oh, heart&rsquo;s
      beloved, if you knew&mdash;&rdquo; And the burning, passionate words, the
      pent-up love and longing of months of separation and despair, came pouring
      from his lips&mdash;beseeching and demanding, wringing her heart, pulling
      at the love within her that ached to give him the answer which he craved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Blaise, dearest of all&mdash;hush! Hush!&rdquo; She checked him
      brokenly, with quivering lips. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go with you. It wouldn&rsquo;t
      bring us happiness. Ah, listen to me, dear!&rdquo; She came close to him
      and laid her hands imploringly on his arm, lifting her white, stricken
      face to his. &ldquo;It would only spoil our love&mdash;to take it like
      that when we have no right to. It would smirch and soil it, make it
      something different. I think&mdash;I think, in the end, Blaise, it would
      kill it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing would ever kill my love for you,&rdquo; he exclaimed
      passionately. &ldquo;Jean, little Jean, think of what our life together
      might be&mdash;the glory and beauty of it&mdash;just you and I in our
      House of Dreams!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught her breath. Oh! Why did he make it so hard for her? With every
      fibre of her being yearning towards him she must refuse, deny him, drive
      him away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried tremulously. &ldquo;We could never reach
      our House of Dreams that way&mdash;Oh, I know it! At least, not the sort
      of House of Dreams that would be worth anything to you or me, Blaise. It
      would only be a sham, a make-believe. You can&rsquo;t build true on a
      rotten foundation.... Don&rsquo;t ask me any more, dear. It&rsquo;s so
      hard&mdash;so hard to keep on saying no when everything in me wants to say
      yes. But I must say it. And you... you must go back to Nesta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice almost failed her. She could feel her strength ebbing with every
      moment that he stayed beside her. She knew that she would not be able to
      resist his pleading much longer. Her own heart was fighting against her&mdash;fighting
      on his side!
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her weakness and caught at it eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re asking?&rdquo; he demanded hoarsely.
      &ldquo;Do you know what you are sending me back to? Our life together&mdash;Nesta&rsquo;s
      and mine&mdash;has been simple hell upon earth. I obeyed you&mdash;and I
      took her back. But I have done no good by it. She is as weak and worthless
      as she ever was. Our days are one continual round of bickering and
      quarrels.&rdquo; His face darkened. &ldquo;And she is not satisfied! Her
      nominal position as my wife does not con tent her. Do you understand what
      that must mean&mdash;if I go back?&rdquo; He paused, his eyes bent
      steadily upon her. &ldquo;Jean&rdquo;&mdash;very low&mdash;&ldquo;now that
      you know&mdash;will you still send me back to Nesta? Or will you come with
      me and let us find our happiness together?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched the scarlet flood surge into her face and then retreat, leaving
      it a pallid white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me!&rdquo; he persisted, as she remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait... wait a little...&rdquo; she muttered helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away from him and, leaning her elbows on the chimney-piece,
      buried her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supreme test had come at last. She realised, now, that her
      renunciation&mdash;that renunciation which had cost her so much pain and
      bitterness&mdash;had been, after all, only something superficial and
      incomplete. She had not made the full sacrifice that duty and honour
      demanded of her. Though she had outwardly renounced her lover&mdash;bade
      him return to Nesta&mdash;she still held him hers by the utter
      faithfulness of his love for her. Nesta had had but the husk, the shell&mdash;a
      husband in name only, every hour of their life together an insult to her
      pride and womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s thoughts lashed her. Her shoulders bent and cowered a little
      as though beneath a physical blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a time&mdash;oh! very long ago, it seemed, before Destiny
      had come with her snuffers and quenched the twin flames and love and
      happiness&mdash;a time when dimly, as in some exquisite dream, she had
      heard the sound of little voices, felt the helpless touch of tiny hands.
      Perhaps Nesta, too, had heard those voices, felt those clinging hands,
      while her soul quickened to the vision of a future which might hold some
      deeper meaning, some more sacred trust and purpose, than her empty,
      wayward past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, Jean, had stood between Nesta and the fulfilment of that dream,
      forever forbidding her entrance to her woman&rsquo;s kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw it all now with a terrible clarity of vision, understood to the
      full the two alternatives which faced her&mdash;to go with Blaise, as he
      implored, or to send him&mdash;her man, the man she loved&mdash;back to
      Nesta. There was no longer any middle course.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice sounded in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No true happiness ever came of running away from duty. And if
      ever I&rsquo;m up against such a thing&mdash;a choice like this&mdash;I
      hope to God I&rsquo;d be able to hang on, to run straight, even if it
      half-killed me to do it!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The words sounded so clear and distinct that Jean half raised her head to
      see who spoke them. And then, in an overwhelming rush of memory, she
      recognised that it was no actual voice she heard but the mental echo of
      her own words to Nick&mdash;to Nick at the time when he had been passing
      through a like fire of fierce temptation.
    </p>
    <p>
      How easily, in her young, untried ignorance, the words had fallen from her
      lips as she had urged Nick to renounce his fixed resolve! Such eminently
      wise and excellent counsel! And how little&mdash;how crassly little had
      she realised at the time the huge demand that she was making!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken as though it were comparatively easy to reject the wrong
      and choose the right&mdash;to follow the stern and narrow path of Duty,
      through the mists and utter darkness that enshrouded it, up to those
      shining heights which lie beyond human sight&mdash;the outposts of Eternal
      Heaven itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Easy!</i>.... Oh, God!....
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last Jean uncovered her face and lifted it to meet the set gaze of
      the man beside her, it was wan and ravaged &ldquo;the face of one who has
      come through some fierce purgatory of torment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, his voice roughened because he found
      himself unable to steady it with that strained and altered face upturned
      to his. &ldquo;Well? Are you going to send me back to Nesta?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer his question. Instead, she put another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think she&mdash;loves you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nesta? Yes. As far as her sort can love, I believe she does.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean nodded, as though it were the answer she had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise... I&rsquo;m going to send you back to her. I&rsquo;m sure
      now. I <i>know</i>. It&rsquo;s the only thing we can do... We must say
      good-bye&mdash;altogether&mdash;never see each other again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never?&rdquo; The word came draggingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never. It&mdash;it would be too hard for us, Blaise, to see each
      other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;It would be too hard.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both silent. The minutes ticked away unregarded. Time had ceased
      to count. This farewell was till the end of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise&mdash;&rdquo; All the resonance had gone out of her voice.
      It sounded flat and tired. &ldquo;You&mdash;you will go back to her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will go back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She stretched out her hands flutteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go.... go soon, Blaise! I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear very much
      more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened his arms, then, and she went to him, and for a space they clung
      together in silence. For the last time he set his lips to hers, held her
      once more against his heart. Then slowly they drew apart, stricken eyes
      gazing lingeringly into other eyes as stricken, and presently the closing
      of the terrace door told her that he had gone, and that she must turn her
      feet to the solitary path of those who have said farewell to love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforth, she would be alone&mdash;living or dying, quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long past midnight when Claire returned from the Dower House.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found Jean sitting beside the grey embers of a burnt-out fire, her
      hands lying folded upon her knee, her eyes staring stonily in front of her
      in a fixed, unseeing gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire called to her softly, as when one wakes a sleeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jean!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have got back?&rdquo; she said dully. She stood up stiffly,
      as though her limbs were cramped. &ldquo;Claire, I am going away&mdash;right
      away from here&mdash;to Beirnfels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Claire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She waited tensely for the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise has been here. He asked me to go away with him. I&rsquo;ve
      sent him back to Nesta.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The short, stilted sentences fell mechanically from her lips. She spoke
      exactly like a child repeating a lesson learned by rote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire&rsquo;s eyes grew very pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And must you go to Beirnfels alone?&rdquo; she asked quietly.
      &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you take me with you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Will you come?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I&rsquo;ll come. I shouldn&rsquo;t dream of letting you
      go by yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, all at once, Jean&rsquo;s tired body, exhausted by the soul&rsquo;s
      long conflict, gave way, and she slipped to the ground in a dead faint.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV&mdash;THE EVE OF DEPARTURE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> WEEK later Jean
      sat at the foot of the stairs and surveyed with faint amusement the motley
      collection of trunks and suit-cases which thronged the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still looking pale and worn, strung up to face her self-imposed
      exile from the country which now held everything that was dear to her, but
      no enormity of sorrow, would ever blind Jean for long to the whimsical
      aspect that attends so many of the little things of daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a lot of useless lumber we women carry about with us wherever
      we go!&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;Five&mdash;six&mdash;<i>seven</i>
      packages to supply the needs of two solitary females&mdash;and Heaven only
      knows how many brown paper parcels will be required at the last moment for
      all the things we shall find we have forgotten when the time actually
      comes to start.&rdquo; Claire, standing on the flight of stairs above and
      viewing the assemblage in the hall from over the top of the banister rail,
      giggled helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they do look a lot,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;However&rdquo;&mdash;hopefully&mdash;&ldquo;there&rsquo;ll
      be plenty of room for them all when we actually get to Beirnfels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, plenty,&rdquo; agreed Jean. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to
      convey them half across Europe first&mdash;two lone women and one
      miserable maid who will probably combine train-sickness and home-sickness
      to an extent that will totally incapacitate her for the performance of her
      duties.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the front-door bell clanged violently through the house, as
      though pulled by someone in a tremendous hurry. Claire hastily withdrew
      her head from over the banister rail and disappeared upstairs, while Jean
      relinquished the accommodation offered by the bottommost step and sought
      refuge in the nearest of the sitting-rooms, closing the door stealthily
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Tucker, who had caught sight of her hurriedly retreating
      figure, reopened it and announced imperturbably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Burke.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean greeted him with surprise, but without any feeling of embarrassment.
      So much had happened since the day she had eluded him on the Moor, events
      of such intimate and tragic import had swept her path, that the unexpected
      meeting failed to rouse any feeling either of anger or dismay. Burke, and
      everything connected with him, belonged to another period of her existence
      altogether&mdash;to that glorious care-free time when it had seemed as
      though life were a deep, inexhaustible well bubbling over with wonderful
      possibilities. Burke was merely a ghost&mdash;a <i>revenant</i> from that
      far distant epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in time, then?&rdquo; he said, when he had shaken hands.
      &ldquo;In time? In time for what?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In time to see you before you go.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; Jean spoke lightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in time for
      that. But who told you I was going away? I didn&rsquo;t know you were in
      England, even.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back a fortnight ago&mdash;to London. Judith wired me from
      home that you were leaving Coombe Eavie.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the necessity for her wiring you,&rdquo; remarked
      Jean a little coldly. &ldquo;There was no need for you to see me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was&mdash;every need.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him keenly, detecting a new note in his voice, an
      unexpected gravity and restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every need,&rdquo; he repeated. He paused, then went on quickly,
      with a nervousness that was foreign to him. &ldquo;Jean, I know everything
      that has happened&mdash;that your engagement to Tormarin is at an end&mdash;and
      I have come to ask you if you will be my wife. No&mdash;hear me out!&rdquo;&mdash;as
      she would have interrupted him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you now as&mdash;as
      I did before. If you will marry me, I swear I will ask for nothing that
      you are not willing to give. I&rsquo;m making no demands. I&rsquo;ve
      learned now&rdquo;&mdash;with a faint weary smile&mdash;&ldquo;that you
      cannot force love. It can only be given. And I want nothing but just the
      right to take care of you, to shield you&mdash;to keep the sharp corners
      of life away from you.&rdquo; Then, as he read her incredulous face, he
      went on gravely: &ldquo;If I had wanted more than that, Jean, if I had not
      learned something&mdash;just from loving you, I should not have waited
      until now. I should have come at once&mdash;as soon as I learned from
      Madame de Varigny that Tormarin&rsquo;s wife was still alive.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come then, Geoffrey? I sometimes wondered&mdash;you
      being you!&rdquo;&mdash;with a faint smile. &ldquo;Because, of course, I
      knew why you had rushed off to France. Madame de Varigny explained that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull flush mounted to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she? I expect she told you merely what was the truth. I went to
      see her because she had assured me that she could stop your marriage with
      Tormarin&mdash;could interfere in some way to prevent it. That was why I
      went to France.... But when she told me her blackguardly scheme&mdash;how
      she had planned and plotted to conceal the fact that Tormarin&rsquo;s wife
      was alive&mdash;<i>and why</i> she had done it, I would have no hand in
      anything that followed. I&rsquo;m no saint&rdquo;&mdash;a brief, ironical
      smile flitted across his face&mdash;&ldquo;but there are some methods at
      which even I draw the line.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So&mdash;that was why you stayed away?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was why. I wanted you, Jean&mdash;God only knows how I wanted
      you!&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t try to force your hand at such a time. I
      couldn&rsquo;t profit by a damnable scheme like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s eyes grew soft as she realised that beneath all the impetuous
      arrogance and dominant demands of the man&rsquo;s temperament there yet
      lay something fine and clean and straight&mdash;difficult to get at,
      perhaps, but which could yet rise, in answer to a sense of honour and
      fairness with which she had not credited him, and take command of his
      whole nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad&mdash;glad you didn&rsquo;t come, Geoffrey,&rdquo;
      she said gently. &ldquo;Glad you&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;m glad about it,&rdquo; he returned
      with a grim candour. &ldquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t do it, and that&rsquo;s
      all there is to it. But I&rsquo;ve come now, Jean. I&rsquo;ve come because
      I want you to give me just the right to look after you. I&rsquo;m not
      asking for anything. I only want to serve you&mdash;if you&rsquo;ll let me&mdash;just
      to be near you. If Tormarin were free, I would not have come to you again.
      I know I should have no chance. But he&rsquo;s not free. Does that give me
      a chance, Jean? If it doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll take myself off&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      never bother you again. I&rsquo;ll try Africa&mdash;big game shooting&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a short laugh. &ldquo;But if it does&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and waited for her answer. The intensity of longing in his eyes
      was the sole indication of the emotion that stirred within him&mdash;an
      emotion held in check by a stern self-control that seemed to Jean to be
      part of this new, changed lover of hers. Surely, in the months which had
      elapsed since she had fled from him on Dartmoor, he had fought with his
      devils and cast them out!
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out her hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Geoffrey, I&rsquo;m so sorry&mdash;but I&rsquo;m afraid it doesn&rsquo;t.
      I wish&mdash;I wish I could give you any other answer. But, you see, it
      isn&rsquo;t marrying&mdash;it&rsquo;s love that matters. And all my love
      is given.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hands in his and held them gently with that strange, new
      restraint he seemed to have learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said slowly. Then for a moment his calm wavered.
      The underlying passion, so strongly held in leash, shook the even tones of
      his voice. &ldquo;Tormarin is a lucky man&mdash;in spite of everything! I&rsquo;d
      give my soul to have what he has&mdash;your love, Jean.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His big hands closed round her slight ones and he lifted them to his lips.
      Then, without another word, he went away, and Jean was left wondering
      sorrowfully why the love that she did not want was offered her in such
      full measure, hers to take at will, while the love for which she craved,
      the love which would have meant the glory and fulfilment of life itself,
      was denied her&mdash;shut away by all the laws of God and Man.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI&mdash;REUNION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">J</span>EAN leaned idly
      against the ancient wall which bounded the stone-paved court at Beirnfels
      and looked down towards the valley below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring was in the air&mdash;late comer to this eastern corner of Europe&mdash;but,
      at last, even here the fragrance of fresh growing things was permeating
      the atmosphere, strips of vivid blue rent the grey skies, and splashes of
      golden sunshine lay dappled over the shining roofs of the village that
      nestled in the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no responsive light had lit itself in Jean&rsquo;s wistful eyes. She
      was out of tune with the season. Spring and hope go hand in hand, the one
      symbolical of the other, and the promise of spring-time, the blossom of
      hope, was dead within her heart&mdash;withered almost before it had had
      time to bud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The months since she had quitted England had sufficed to blunt the keen
      edge of her pain, but always she was conscious of a dull, unending ache&mdash;a
      corroding sense of the uselessness and emptiness of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet she had learned to be thankful for even this much respite from the
      piercing agony of the first few weeks which she had spent at Beirnfels.
      Whatever the coming years might bring her of relief from pain, or even of
      some modicum of joy, those weeks when she had suffered the torments of the
      damned would remain stamped indelibly upon her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last days at Charnwood she had been keyed up to a high pitch of
      endurance by the very magnitude of the renunciation she had made. It seems
      as though, when the soul strains upwards to the accomplishment of some
      deed that is almost beyond the power of weak human nature to achieve,
      there is vouchsafed, for the time being, a merciful oblivion to the
      immensity of pain involved. A transport of spiritual fervour lifts the
      martyr beyond any ordinary recognition of the physical fire that burns and
      chars his flesh, and some such ecstasy of sacrifice had supported Jean
      through the act of abnegation by which she had surrendered her love, and
      with it her life&rsquo;s happiness, at the foot of the stern altar of
      Duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards had followed the preparations and bustle of departure, the
      necessary arrangements to be made and telegraphed to Beirnfels, and
      finally the long journey across Europe and the hundred and one small
      details that required settlement before she and Claire were fully
      installed at Beirnfels and the wheels of the household machinery running
      smoothly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when all this was accomplished, when the need to arrange and plan and
      make decisions had gone by and her mind was free to concern itself again
      with her own affairs, then Jean realised the full price of her
      renunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she paid it. In days that were an endless procession of anguished
      hours; in sleepless nights that were a mental and physical torment of
      unbearable longing such as she had never dreamed of; in tears and in dumb,
      helpless silences, she paid it. And at last, out of those racked and
      tortured weeks she emerged into a numbed, listless capacity to pick up
      once more the torn and mutilated threads of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking backward, she marvelled at the wonderful patience with which
      Claire had borne with her, at the selfless way in which she had devoted
      all her energies to ministering to one who was suffering from
      heart-sickness&mdash;that most wearying of all complaints to the sufferer&rsquo;s
      friends because so difficult of comprehension by those not similarly
      afflicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nick&rsquo;s &ldquo;pale golden narcissus!&rdquo; To Jean, who had clung
      to her, helped inexpressibly by her tranquil, steadfast, unswerving faith
      and loving-kindness, it seemed as though the staunch and sturdy oak were a
      more appropriate metaphor in which to express the soul of Claire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard her now, coming with light steps across the court. She rarely
      left Jean brooding long alone these days, exercising all her tact and
      ingenuity to devise some means by which she might distract her thoughts
      when she could see they had slipped back into the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean turned to greet her with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my good angel? Come to rout me out? I suppose&rdquo;&mdash;teasingly&mdash;&ldquo;you
      want me to ride down to the village and bring back two lemons urgently
      demanded by the cook?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire laughed a little. Many had been the transparent little devices she
      had employed to beguile Jean into the saddle, knowing well that once she
      was on the back of her favourite mare the errand which was the ostensible
      purpose of the occasion would quite probably be entirely forgotten. But
      Jean would return from a long ride over the beloved hills and valleys that
      had been familiar to her from childhood with a faint colour in her pale
      cheeks, and with the shadow in her eyes a little lightened. There is no
      cure for sickness of the soul like the big, open spaces of the earth and
      God&rsquo;s clean winds and sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Claire, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not lemons this time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is it?&rdquo; demanded Jean. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t come
      out here just to look at the view. There&rsquo;s an air of importance
      about you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Claire wore a little fluttering aspect of excitement. The
      colour came and went swiftly in her cheeks, and her eyes had a bright,
      almost dazzled look, while a small anxious frown kept appearing between
      her pretty brows. She regarded Jean uncertainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, it is something,&rdquo; she acknowledged. &ldquo;I
      had a letter from Lady Anne this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Both girls had their <i>premiers déjeuners</i> served to them in their
      rooms, so that each one&rsquo;s morning mail was an unknown quantity to
      the other until they met downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From Lady Anne?&rdquo; Jean looked interested. &ldquo;What does she
      say?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says&mdash;she writes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here Claire
      floundered and came to a stop as though uncertain how to proceed, the
      little puzzled frown deepening between her brows. &ldquo;Oh, Jean, she had
      a special reason for writing&mdash;some news&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s arm, hanging slackly at her side, jerked suddenly. Something
      in Claire&rsquo;s half-frightened, deprecating air sent a thrill of
      foreboding through her. Her heart turned to ice within her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;News?&rdquo; she said in a harsh, strangled voice. &ldquo;Tell me
      quick&mdash;what is it?... Blaise? He&rsquo;s not&mdash;dead?&rdquo; Her
      face, drained of every drop of colour, her suddenly pinched nostrils and
      eyes stricken with quick fear drew a swift cry from Claire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No&mdash;no!</i>&rdquo; she exclaimed in hasty reassurance.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>good</i> news! Good&mdash;-not bad!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s taut muscles relaxed and she leaned against the wall as
      though seeking support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You frightened me,&rdquo; she said dully. &ldquo;Good news? Then it
      can&rsquo;t be for me. What is it, Claire? Is Nick&rdquo;&mdash;forcing a
      smile&mdash;&ldquo;coming out here to see you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nick&mdash;and Blaise with him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blaise&mdash;coming here? Oh, but he must not&mdash;he mustn&rsquo;t
      come!&rdquo;&mdash;in sudden panic. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t go through it
      all again! I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire slipped an arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Because,
      Jean-Jean! Blaise has the right to come now. He&rsquo;s free!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free? <i>Free?</i>&rdquo; repeated Jean. &ldquo;What do you mean!
      How can he be free?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nesta is dead,&rdquo; said Claire simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; Jean began to laugh a trifle hysterically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s been &lsquo;dead&rsquo; before. But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is really dead this time,&rdquo; said Claire. &ldquo;That is
      why Lady Anne has written&mdash;to tell us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; muttered Jean. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
      believe it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>must</i> believe it,&rdquo; insisted Claire quietly. &ldquo;It
      is all quite true. She was buried last week in the little churchyard at
      Coombe Eavie, and Lady Anne writes that Nick and Blaise will be here
      almost as soon as her letter. They&rsquo;re on their way now&mdash;<i>now</i>,
      Jean! Do you understand?&rdquo; Her eyes filling with tears, Claire
      watched the gradual realisation of the amazing truth dawn in Jean&rsquo;s
      face. That face so tragically worn, so fined and spiritualised by
      suffering, glowed with a new light; a glory of unimaginable hope lit
      itself in the tired golden eyes, and on the half-parted lips there seemed
      to quiver those kisses which still waited to be claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean passed her hand across her eyes like one who has seen some bright
      light of surpassing radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Claire,&rdquo; she said at last, tremulously. &ldquo;Tell
      me...&rdquo; She broke off, unable to manage her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read you what Lady Anne says,&rdquo; replied Claire
      quickly. &ldquo;After writing that Nesta is dead and Nick and Blaise are
      coming here, she goes on: &lsquo;Poor Nesta! One cannot help feeling sorry
      for her&mdash;killed so suddenly and so tragically. And yet such a death
      seems quite in the picture with her lawless, wayward nature! She was shot,
      Claire, shot in the Boundary Woods by a Frenchman who had apparently
      followed her to England for the express purpose. It appears he met her at
      Château Varigny, in the days when she was posing as Madame de Varigny&rsquo;s
      niece, and fell violently in love with her. Of course Nesta could not
      marry him, and equally of course the Frenchman&mdash;he was the Vicomte de
      Chassaigne&mdash;did not know that she had a husband already. So,
      naturally, he hoped eventually to win her, and Nesta, (who, as you know,
      would flirt with the butcher&rsquo;s boy if there were no one else handy)
      encouraged him and allowed him to make love to her to his heart&rsquo;s
      content. Then, after her return to Staple, he learned of her marriage,
      and, furious at having been so utterly deceived, he followed. He must have
      watched her very carefully for some days, as he apparently knew her
      favourite walks, and waylaid her one afternoon in the woods. What passed
      between them we shall never know, for Chassaigne killed her and then
      immediately turned the revolver on himself. Blaise and Nick heard the
      shots and rushed down to the Boundary Woods where the shots had sounded&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      know where I mean, the woods that lie along the border between Willow
      Ferry and Staple. There they found them. Nesta was dead, and de Chassaigne
      dying. He had just strength enough to confide in Blaise all that I have
      written. I am writing to you, because I think it might come as too great a
      shock to Jean as you say she is still so far from strong. You must tell
      her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean interrupted the reading with a shout of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Claire! Claire! You blessed infant! I suppose all those
      preliminary remarks of yours about &lsquo;a letter from Lady Anne&rsquo;
      and the &lsquo;news&rsquo; it contained were by way of preparing me for
      the shock&mdash;&lsquo;breaking the news&rsquo; in fact?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Claire, flushing a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean rocked with laughter&mdash;gay, spontaneous laughter such as Claire
      had not heard issue from her lips since the day when Madame de Varigny had
      come to Staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you just about succeeded in frightening me to death!&rdquo;
      continued Jean. &ldquo;Oh, Claire, Claire, you adorable little goose, didn&rsquo;t
      you know that good news never kills?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t feel at all sure,&rdquo; returned Claire, laughing a
      little, too, in spite of herself. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve looked lately as
      though it wouldn&rsquo;t take very much of anything&mdash;good or bad&mdash;to
      kill you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it would now,&rdquo; Jean assured her solemnly. &ldquo;Not
      all the powers of darkness would prevail against me, I verily believe.&rdquo;
      She paused, frowning a little. &ldquo;How beastly it is though, to feel
      outrageously happy because someone is dead! It&rsquo;s indecent. Poor
      little Nesta! Oh, Claire! Is it hateful of me to feel like this? Do say it
      isn&rsquo;t, because&mdash;because I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; protested Claire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
      only natural.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it is. And I really <i>am</i> sorry for Nesta&mdash;though
      I&rsquo;m so happy myself that it sort of swamps it. Oh, Claire darling&rdquo;&mdash;the
      shadow passing and sheer gladness of soul bubbling up again into her voice&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
      bound to kiss someone&mdash;at once. It&rsquo;ll have to be you! And look!
      Those two may be here any moment&mdash;Lady Anne said so. I&rsquo;m going
      to make myself beautiful&mdash;if I can. I wish I hadn&rsquo;t grown so
      thin! The most ravishing frock in the world would look a failure draped on
      a clothes-horse. Still, I&rsquo;ll do what I can to conceal from Blaise
      the hideous ravages of time. And I&rsquo;m not going to wear black&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t welcome him back in sackcloth and ashes! I won&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t!
      I&rsquo;ve got the darlingest frock upstairs&mdash;a filmy grey thing like
      moonlight. I&rsquo;m going to wear that. I know&mdash;I know&rdquo;&mdash;-softly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      Glyn would understand.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And if he knew anything at all about it&mdash;and one would like to think
      he did&mdash;it is quite certain Peterson would have approved his daughter&rsquo;s
      decision. For to his incurably romantic spirit, the idea of a woman going
      to meet the lover of whom a malign fate had so nearly robbed her
      altogether, clad in the sable habiliments with which she had paid filial
      tribute to her father&rsquo;s death, would have appeared of all things the
      most incongruous and irreconcilable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that when at last a prehistoric vehicle, chartered from the inn of the
      Green Dragon in the village below, toiled slowly up the hill to Peirnfels
      and Blaise and Nick climbed down from its musty interior, a slender,
      moon-grey figure, which might have been observed standing within the
      shadow of a tall stone pillar and following with straining eyes the
      snail-like progress of the old-fashioned carriage up the steep white road,
      flitted swiftly back into the shelter of the house. Claire, dimpling and
      smiling at the great gateway of the castle, alone received the travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go along that corridor,&rdquo; she said to Blaise, when they had
      exchanged greetings. &ldquo;To the end door of all. That&rsquo;s the
      sun-parlour. You&rsquo;ll find Jean there. She thought it appropriate&rdquo;&mdash;smiling
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Blaise strode down the corridor indicated, she turned to Nick and
      asked him with an adorable coquetry why he, too, had come to Beirnfels?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard it is the House of Dreams-Come-True,&rdquo;
      replied Nick promptly. &ldquo;It seemed a likely place in which to find
      you, most beautiful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire beamed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, am I that&mdash;<i>really</i>, Nick?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you are. The most beautiful in all the world. Claire&rdquo;&mdash;tucking
      his arm into hers&mdash;&ldquo;tell me, how is the &lsquo;soul-rebuilding&rsquo;
      process getting on? That&rsquo;s why I came, really, you know, to find out
      if you had completely finished redecorating your interior?&mdash;I can
      vouch for the outer woman myself&rdquo;&mdash;with an adoring glance at
      the fluffy ash-blonde hair and pure little Greuze profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire rubbed her cheek against his sleeve. To a woman who has been for
      four months limited almost exclusively to the society of one other woman&mdash;even
      though that other woman be her chosen friend&mdash;the rough &lsquo;feel&rsquo;
      of a man&rsquo;s coat-sleeve (more particularly if he should happen to be
      <i>the</i> man) and the faint fragrance of tobacco which pervades it form
      an almost delirious combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claire hauled down her flag precipitately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go back to England any time now, Nick,&rdquo;
      she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you? Darling! How soon can you be ready? In a week? To-morrow?
      Next day?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite soon. And meanwhile, mightn&rsquo;t you&mdash;you and Blaise&mdash;stay
      for a bit at the Green Dragon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might,&rdquo; replied Nick solemnly, quite omitting to mention
      that something of the sort had been precisely their intention when leaving
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Blaise had made his way to the door at the end of the corridor.
      Outside it he paused, overwhelmed by the sudden realisation that beyond
      that wooden barrier lay holy ground&mdash;Paradise! And the Angel with the
      Flaming Sword stood at the gate no longer....
    </p>
    <p>
      She was waiting for him over by the window, straight and slim and tall in
      her moon-grey, her hands hanging in front of her tight-clasped like those
      of a child. But her eyes were woman&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a little inarticulate cry she ran to him&mdash;to the place that was
      hers, now and for all time, against his heart&mdash;and his arms, that had
      been so long empty, held her as though he would never let her go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beloved of my heart!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Oh, my sweet&mdash;my
      sweet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They spoke but little. Only those foolish, tender words that seem so
      meaningless to those who are not lovers, but which are pearls strung on a
      thread of gold to those who love&mdash;a rosary of memory which will be
      theirs to keep and tell again when the beloved voice that uttered them
      shall sound no more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII&mdash;&ldquo;AN HOUSE NOT MADE WITH HANDS&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE landlord of the
      inn of the Green Dragon watched his two English visitors ride away up the
      steep road that led to Beirnfels with unquestionable regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been lodging at the Green Dragon for the past fortnight, and he
      had discovered that English milords, whatever else they might be, were not
      niggardly with their money. They required a good deal of attention, it is
      true, and had a strange, outlandish predilection for innumerable baths,
      demanding a quite unheard-of quantity of water for the same. And at all
      unlikely hours of the day, too&mdash;when returning from a ride or before
      going up to the castle to dine, mark you!
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, they made no difficulty about paying&mdash;and paying handsomely&mdash;for
      all they wanted, and if a man chooses to spend his money upon the
      superfluous scrubbing of his epidermis, it is, after all, his own affair!
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the two English milords were taking their departure from the Green
      Dragon and, so the landlord understood, proposed to stay at the castle
      itself until their return to England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that their lady-mother&mdash;who, it was rumoured in the
      village, was the daughter of an English archduke, no less!&mdash;was
      coming to Beirnfels and there was much talk amongst the village girls of
      weddings and the like. Apparently the Green Dragon&rsquo;s two eccentric
      visitors, not withstanding their altogether abnormal liking for soap and
      water, were much as most men in other respects and had lost their hearts
      to the two pretty English ladies living at the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, no doubt, the &ldquo;daughter of an English archduke, no less&rdquo;
      was coming from England post haste to enquire into the suitability of the
      brides-elect&mdash;and also into the important point of the amount of the
      dowry each might be expected to bring her future husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no question that Lady Anne was certainly coming post haste&mdash;in
      reply to a series of joyful and imperative telegrams demanding that she
      should pack up and come to Beirnfels immediately&mdash;&ldquo;for we are
      all enjoying ourselves far too much to return to England at present,&rdquo;
      as Nick wired her with an iniquitous disregard for the cost per word of
      foreign telegrams. And Lady Anne, who always considered money well-spent
      if it purchased happiness, proceeded to wire back with equal extravagance
      that she was delighted to hear it and that she and her maid would start at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very happy party that gathered round the table in the great
      dining-hall at Beirnfels on the night of Lady Anne&rsquo;s arrival, and
      beneath all the surface laughter and gaiety lay the deep, quiet
      thanksgiving that only comes to those who have emerged out of the night of
      darkness and sorrow into a glorious sunlight of happiness and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, in the soft, candle-lit dusk&mdash;for Peterson had never
      introduced the garish anomaly of electric light into the ancient castle&mdash;Jean
      sang to them in that quaintly appealing, husky voice of hers, simple
      tender folk-songs of the country-side, and finally, at a murmured request
      from Blaise, she gave them <i>The House of Dreams</i>. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"It&rsquo;s a strange road leads to the House of Dreams,
      <br /><span class="indent20">To the House of Dreams-Come-True, <br /><span
      class="indent15">Its hills are steep and its valleys deep, <br /><span
      class="indent15">And salt with tears the Wayfarers weep, <br /><span
      class="indent20">The Wayfarers&mdash;I and you. <br /><br /><span
      class="indent15">"But there&rsquo;s sure a way to the House of Dreams,
      <br /><span class="indent20">To the House of Dreams-Come-True. <br /><span
      class="indent15">We shall find it yet, ere the sun has set, <br /><span
      class="indent15">If we fare straight on, come fine, come wet, <br /><span
      class="indent20">Wayfarers&mdash;I and you.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As the last words died away into silence, she looked up and met Blaise&rsquo;s
      eyes. He was leaning against the piano, looking down at her with a
      tranquil happiness in his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Our</i> House of Dreams-Come-True, Jean, at last,&rdquo; he said
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met his glance with one of utter trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we needn&rsquo;t ever fear, now, that it will tumble down. But
      oh! Blaise, if we had built on a rotten foundation, we should never have
      felt safe&mdash;not safe like this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You were right, belovedest&mdash;as you always have been,
      always will be.&rdquo; Then, very low, so that none but she should hear:
      &ldquo;Thank God for you, my sweet!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ultimately settled that the whole party should remain at Beirnfels
      until the latter end of June, when they would all return to England
      together and the two weddings should take place as soon as possible
      afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t have a double wedding,&rdquo; declared Jean.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always supposed to be unlucky.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe in good and bad luck, then?&rdquo; asked Lady Anne,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Jean answered seriously. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      always just as well to be on the safe side. Anyway, we won&rsquo;t tempt
      Fate by running unnecessary risks!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, madonna,&rdquo; added Nick, &ldquo;in the excitement of
      the moment we might get mixed and the parson hitch us up to the wrong
      people. The average nerve-strain attendant upon the rôle of bridegroom
      will be quite sufficient for me, thank you, without the added uncertainty
      as to whether I&rsquo;m getting tied up to the right woman or not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So spring lengthened out into summer, and, as the heat increased, boating
      and swimming on the big lake that nestled in a basin of the hills were
      added to the long rides and excursions with which they whiled away the
      pleasant, sunshiny days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever afterwards, the memory of those tranquil months at Beirnfels would
      linger in the minds of those who shared them as something rare and
      precious. It was as though for this little span of time, passed so far
      away from the noise and bustle of the big world, they had pulled their
      barque out of the busy fairway of the river and moored it in some quiet,
      shady backwater. Then, when they were rested and refreshed, they would be
      ready to face anew, with fresh strength and courage, the difficulties and
      dangers of midstream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it&rsquo;s so nearly over&mdash;this long, long
      holiday of ours,&rdquo; said Jean regretfully. &ldquo;The only thing that
      reconciles me to the fact is that after we&rsquo;re married Blaise and I
      propose to spend at least six months out of every year at Beirnfels.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was lying on her back in the shady wood whither they had ridden out to
      lunch that day, staring up at the bits of blue sky overhead which showed
      between the interlacing branches of the trees. The remainder of the party
      were grouped around her, reclining in various attitudes of a <i>dolce far
      niente</i> nature, while from a little distance away, where the horses
      were picketed in charge of a groom, came the drowsy, rhythmic sound of the
      munching of corn, punctuated by an occasional stamp of an impatient hoof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s been good,&rdquo; agreed Lady Anne. &ldquo;I shall
      never settle down again properly as a dowager at the Dower House!&rdquo;
      And she laughed gleefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her, it had been almost like a return to the days of her youth, for
      &ldquo;her four children&rdquo;&mdash;as she called them&mdash;had
      insisted on her sharing in all their active pursuits, and Lady Anne, who
      in her girlhood and early married life had been a first-class horsewoman
      and a magnificent swimmer, had consented <i>con amore</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise pulled himself lazily up into a sitting posture and glanced toward
      the crimson glow of westering sun where it struck athwart the tall trunks
      of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll none of you live to go back to England. Instead, you&rsquo;ll
      be dying of pneumonia and a few other complaints&mdash;if we don&rsquo;t
      get a move on soon,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost sunset,
      and after that it grows abominably chilly in this eastern paradise of Jean&rsquo;s.
      Besides, I fancy it&rsquo;s going to blow great guns before long.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Already a little chill whisper of wind was shaking the tops
      of the trees, and before the party was fairly mounted and away, the
      whisper had changed to a shrill whistling, heralding the big gale which
      drove along behind the innocent seeming breeze which at first had barely
      rocked the topmost branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a longish ride back to Beirnfels, and the sun had dipped below the
      horizon in a sullen splendour of purple and red before the shoulder of the
      hill, upon the further side of which the castle stood, came into sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and again the moon peered out between the racing, wind-driven clouds,
      clearly limning the bold, black curve of the hill against a background of
      lowering sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean and Blaise were riding abreast, a little in advance of the rest,
      engrossed by the difficulties of carrying on an animated conversation in a
      high wind. As they swung round the bend in the road which brought the hill&rsquo;s
      great shoulder into view, Jean threw back her head and stared at the sky
      above it with a puzzled frown on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why... how queer!&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;The sun set nearly
      half an hour ago and yet there&rsquo;s still quite a brilliant red glow in
      the sky. Look, Blaise&mdash;just above where Beirnfels stands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaise glanced up casually in the direction indicated, then suddenly
      reigned in his horse and half-rose in the stirrups, staring at the red
      glow deepening in the sky ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no sunset!&rdquo; he exclaimed sharply. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;Great
      heavens, Jean! Beirnfels is <i>on fire!</i>&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as he spoke a tongue of flame, mocking the dull glow with its
      gleaming blaze, shot up like a thin red knife into the sky and sank again.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shout came from behind. The others had seen it, also, and recognised its
      deadly import. The next moment the clatter of galloping hoofs echoed along
      the road as the whole party urged their horses on towards home as fast as
      they could cover the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they struck off from the road, taking a bridle-path which slanted
      through the woods clothing the base of the hill, and as they emerged on to
      the broad plateau where Beirnfels had stood sentinel through wind and
      weather for so many years, the whole extent of the catastrophe was
      revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the angry glow in the sky had turned dusk into day, while
      from the doors and windows of the castle fire vomited forth as from a
      furnace&mdash;upward in long, sinuous tongues of flame, licking the
      blackened walls, downward in spangled showers of sparks that drifted
      towards the earth like flights of golden butterflies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little groups of men and women, helpless as ants to stay the fire, rushed
      futilely hither and thither with hosepipe and engine, while on the smooth
      sward which fronted the castle lay piled enormous quantities of household
      stuff a medley of fine old furniture, torn tapestry wrenched from its place
      against the walls, pictures, mirrors&mdash;anything and everything that
      could be dragged out into the open by eager hands and willing arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The major-domo, an elderly, grey-haired man who had been born and reared
      upon the estate and who had taken service with Glyn Peterson on the day
      when he had first brought Jacqueline, a bride, to Beirnfels, caught sight
      of the riding-party returned and came hurrying to Jean&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears were running down his wrinkled face as he recounted the
      discovery of the fire, which must have started either just before or
      during the servants&rsquo; dinner-hour, when few people, of course, were
      about the castle, and which had obtained a firm hold before it was
      detected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The household staff, practised to a limited extent,&mdash;a fire drill had
      been held once a month in Peterson&rsquo;s time&mdash;had done their hest
      to cope with the flames, but vainly. The high wind which had arisen had
      thwarted their utmost efforts, and finally giving up all hope of saving
      the interior from being gutted, they had confined themselves to rescuing
      such valuables as could be easily removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the usual mystery as to how the fire had originated, and several
      stories circulated amongst the chattering throng which hurried hither and
      thither, momentarily augmented by the peasants who, at sight of the castle
      in flames, had come trooping up the hill from the village below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most likely story, and the one to which Blaise inclined to give most
      credence, was that the child of a woman who worked daily at the castle,
      escaping from its mother&rsquo;s care and launched on an independent
      voyage of discovery through the rooms, had knocked over a burning lamp.
      Then, terrified at the immediate consequences&mdash;the sudden flaring of
      some ancient tapestry, dry as tinder with the summer heat, near which the
      lamp had fallen&mdash;he had bolted away, out of the castle and so home,
      too scared to tell anyone of the accident.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as Jean commented mournfully, what did it matter how it happened?
      Except from the prosaic viewpoint of the fire insurance company, who would
      probably desire to know: all kinds of details that it was impossible to
      supply!
    </p>
    <p>
      For her, nothing mattered except that Beirnfels, her home from childhood
      and the place where she and Blaise had proposed to spend a great part of
      their married life, was a furnace of flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a splendid but very terrible sight The great, grim walls of the
      castle stood four-square against the sky, charred and blackened but
      defiantly impervious to the flames that were licking covetously against
      the solid stone which fashioned them. Sentinel to the very end, they
      reared themselves unvanquished, guardians still, though all that they had
      sheltered through their centuries of watch and ward lay consumed within
      their very heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean, standing beside Blaise and watching the upward tossing flames and
      the crimson banner of the lowering heavens, spoke suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the sky as red as blood above it.&rsquo; Blaise, the
      last of Keturah Stanley&rsquo;s prophecies has come true!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later help was forthcoming from the distant town to which a
      messenger had been despatched post haste as soon as it was realised that
      the household staff, even with assistance from the village, was hopelessly
      inadequate to cope with a fire of such magnitude. But it was already too
      late to accomplish very much in the way of salvage. All that remained
      possible was to quench that inferno of fire as soon as might be and so,
      perhaps, save some of the outbuildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour through the night, human endeavour fought with the flames&mdash;subduing
      them again and again only to find them kindling into fresh life at the
      gusty bidding of the wind, leaping redly from the lambent heart of the
      conflagration, which glowed and pulsed and heaved like some living monster
      intent upon destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until dawn was breaking that, with the dying down of the wind,
      the flickering crimson light faded finally from the sky; and half an hour
      later, when the fire had been at last extinguished, the village folk,
      gathered about the scene of the catastrophe, had dispersed to their homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Anne, accompanied by Nick and Claire, started for the inn of the
      Green Dragon, whither the landlord had hurried on ahead to prepare
      temporary quarters for the now homeless little company from the castle.
      But Jean and Blaise still lingered by the deserted ruins, loth to say
      farewell to the place that had meant so much to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath the misty azure of the summer morning sky, fanned by little
      vagrant zephyrs&mdash;rearguard of the hurricane which had passed&mdash;stood
      all that remained of Beirnfels&mdash;blackened, naked walls, stark against
      that tender blue, brooding above a mass of cooling wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean&rsquo;s mouth quivered a little as her glance took in the scene of
      utter desolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My House of Dreams,&rdquo; she whispered brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a few moments, her eyes embracing all that had once
      been Beirnfels in a gaze which held both farewell and retrospect. And
      something more&mdash;some vision of the future. In the dawn-light pearling
      the sky above she recognised the eternal promise of Him Who &ldquo;commanded
      the light to shine out of darkness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her House of Dreams! The inner meaning of the song had grown suddenly
      clear to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she turned again to Blaise, her expression was serene and tranquil.
      Touched with regret perhaps, but bravely confident.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it matters, Blaise,&rdquo; she said simply.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
